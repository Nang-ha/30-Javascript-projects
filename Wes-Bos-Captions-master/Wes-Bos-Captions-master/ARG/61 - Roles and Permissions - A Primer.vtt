00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Instructor>Alright, let's get into permissions, roles,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.040
and access functions a little bit.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.030
I'm gonna take this first video

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.080
just to explain the different pieces of the stuff

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.440
that we're gonna be working with.

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.250
This stuff is inherently kind of complicated

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.860
because when you get into like real applications,

8
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.810
you need some very complex rules

9
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.660
as to who can access what, who can do what,

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.980
if you're an admin, can you do something if you own it?

11
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.940
Can you see it?

12
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.790
If you own it, can you delete it?

13
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.650
Can you update it?

14
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.510
Can you only update some of the fields on something

15
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.160
if you are a specific user?

16
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.050
So, whew!

17
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.050
It gets confusing, but let's get into it now.

18
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
At the very basics, we have these things

19
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.130
that are going to be referred to as permissions.

20
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.720
And permissions are going to be just like,

21
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.540
these are just gonna be check boxes of

22
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.170
can someone do something or not?

23
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.170
So, something like, can see all users, or can edit products.

24
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.233
Things like that is going to be,

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.620
these are going to be permissions.

26
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.210
And we're going to apply them to things and say,

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.920
yes or no, can you do these things or can you not?

28
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.340
Now, once you have many permissions,

29
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.000
you can sort of bundle those up into what's called a role.

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.550
So you might have an admin where you're allowed

31
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.450
to manage users and you're allowed to manage products

32
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.700
and you're allowed to, maybe you have another one

33
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
which is like editor, and you're allowed to read products

34
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.400
but you're not allowed to delete products, right?

35
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.840
Like you're allowed to do the different levels

36
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.673
of what you want.

37
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.200
So, roles are collection of multiple permissions.

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.200
And then one step further, we have these access functions.

39
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:58.380
So, when it comes down to Keystone saying,

40
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.910
alright, are you allowed to view all this products?

41
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.960
Are you allowed to update all of these products?

42
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.870
Are you allowed to query a list of all the users?

43
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.900
There is very basic yes or no functions.

44
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.140
And those are generally gonna be based upon

45
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.580
what role you have.

46
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.040
So what we'll do is we'll code up a function

47
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.750
and we'll say, can this person read all the users?

48
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.250
And that will either return a yes or a no.

49
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.030
And then one step further is sometimes the answer

50
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.260
to can this person view all the products,

51
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.000
the answer to that is gonna be no, not all of them

52
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.130
but they can view the ones that they created

53
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.470
or maybe another example would be orders.

54
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.090
Can this person read orders?

55
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.180
Well, yes, they can read their own orders,

56
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.850
but no, they can't read all of the orders,

57
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.200
and no, they can't update orders,

58
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.660
and no, they can't edit an order,

59
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.230
and also they can't delete an order.

60
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.900
So in that case, what we would do

61
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050
is we don't return a yes or a no from it,

62
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.970
we're gonna return something like a where clause.

63
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.960
And we're gonna say, okay, give me all the orders

64
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.540
but where the user's ID is equal

65
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.070
to the ID of the currently signed in user.

66
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.620
So, with that sort of high level overlook

67
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.530
over how we're gonna tackle the permissions,

68
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.580
let's get into doing the first part

69
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.863
which is creating a UI for assigning roles.
