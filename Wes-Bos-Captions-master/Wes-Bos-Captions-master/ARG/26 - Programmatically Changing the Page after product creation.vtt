00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Instructor>When we wanna change pages in Next.js,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.660
we just use the link tag, right?

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.910
We've been doing that in the nav,

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.743
and we wanna link it.

5
00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:08.690
You just use the link tag

6
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.980
and it does all the special source behind the scenes

7
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.170
and makes it nice and fast

8
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.003
and pre loads

9
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:14.400
and all that good stuff.

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.960
And that is what is referred to as

11
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.640
a declarative programming, right?

12
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.020
You just declare what you want

13
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.960
and it will figure out

14
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.370
all the logic behind scenes.

15
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.790
Sometimes

16
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.623
in Next.js

17
00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.410
you want to be,

18
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.710
do it imperatively.

19
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.710
Meaning that you want it,

20
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.710
you actually want to programmatically change the page.

21
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.020
And Next.js has APIs for that as well.

22
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.060
So if we go down here

23
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.180
we are

24
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.040
preventing default or console logging.

25
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.780
We can get rid of that console log,

26
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.190
then we're waiting for the product to be created,

27
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.480
we're clearing the form

28
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.930
and then we need to go to that products page, right?

29
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.660
Like we need to show them the product that they did.

30
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.550
And we can import the Next.js Router

31
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.383
and

32
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.410
do that for us.

33
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.770
So we basically in the go up here

34
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.420
and we'll import capital R router from next

35
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.943
forward/router.

36
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.390
And that will then allow us to go here

37
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.770
and say, router

38
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710
dot push.

39
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.070
And we want to

40
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.270
pass out an object with the path name.

41
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.730
Is going to be able use back text here

42
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.070
forward slash product

43
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.440
forward slash

44
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.150
and we're gonna take the response.

45
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.080
So now we need it.

46
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.600
So we'll say cons response is equal to at

47
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.433
response

48
00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.560
dot data

49
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.640
dot create

50
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.130
product

51
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.170 line:15% 
dot it.

52
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 line:15% 
Right, so we're gonna take the returned ID

53
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.500 line:15% 
and simply just go to that page

54
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.080
with the router.push.

55
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.470
There also is additional values

56
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.950
that you can pass along here.

57
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.210
You can check out the Next.js docs for that.

58
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.610
The one that I will sometimes need to use is

59
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.720
If you have query parameters like,

60
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.630
something like this,

61
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.880
like

62
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.130
ID is equal to one, two, three, four

63
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830
you could do that.

64
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.510
But in our case is simply just a clean URL.

65
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.640
and the idea of the product

66
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680
is actually gonna be part of the URL.

67
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.200
So I don't need to pass query parameters in this case.

68
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.110
So

69
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.890
what I really like about that

70
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.990
is we don't have to like start that little

71
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.830
Nprogress along the top,

72
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.060
because Nprogress listens for the router

73
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.210
to start changing.

74
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.240
So here we go,

75
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.460
browse,

76
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.580
upload,

77
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.413
add product

78
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.453
and then done.

79
00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.070
And what it did is it changed the product

80
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.090
and then put the ID.

81
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.860
We have opposite are not showing anything yet

82
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.160
cause we have yet to build this specific page,

83
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.399
but that logic is finished.

84
00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.687
See you in the next one.
