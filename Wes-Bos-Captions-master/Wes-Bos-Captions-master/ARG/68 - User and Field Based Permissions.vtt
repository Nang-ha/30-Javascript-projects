00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Instructor>All right, this one's going to be a two step</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.010
because we are working with the user

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.590
and we're gonna have the very basic access.

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.000
Then we'll control the UI.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.380
But this one gets a little tricky because

6
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.600
somebody should be able to create a user

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.840
that's signing up,

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.110
but they should not be able to update their role

9
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.120
to be admin.(chuckles)

10
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.470
Otherwise, then you can just update yourself to be an admin

11
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.140
and you could go, go wild on it.

12
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.450
So let's get into it.

13
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.283
First,

14
00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:28.010
we'll open up our access dot TS,

15
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.390
and we'll make a new value.

16
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.830
Let's take the

17
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.253
can order.

18
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.380
And let's just copy that.

19
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.230
Go to the bottom here.

20
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.570
And we'll make that one called

21
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.110
can manage users.

22
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.130
And here, if they're not signed in, you can't.

23
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.220
Do they have permission to manage the users?

24
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.250
Let's take a look at what that field is called.

25
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.160
Can manage users.

26
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.993
There we go.

27
00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:57.680
So if they have can manage users then true.

28
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.610
Otherwise they may only update themselves so,

29
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.460
we'll put that here.

30
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460
Otherwise they may only update themselves.

31
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.910
So where the user session ID is equal to the currently

32
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.080
logged in user.

33
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.913
Okay.

34
00:01:13.913 --> 00:01:18.560
Then we'll go in to our user and we'll add our access here.

35
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.760
So, access

36
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.280
but create

37
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.490
that will always be true.

38
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330
Everyone can create a user cause that's signing up.

39
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.670
Read, should you be able to read a user,

40
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.240
or you should be able to read yourself,

41
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.640
or everybody if you have the associated permission.

42
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.910
So that's going to be

43
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.373
rules dot can manage users,

44
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.883
and lock to import rules.

45
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.090
Update.

46
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.390
You should be able to update anybody or yourself

47
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.677
if you have permissions,

48
00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:52.860
and then delete is going to only be...

49
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.960
You should not be able to delete yourself.

50
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.730
But if you do have the permission, you should be able to.

51
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.200
So we'll say permissions dot can manage users.

52
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
So this is, this is very clear what the difference is

53
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.480
between permissions and rules is that permissions,

54
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.490
you must have the checkbox under your role.

55
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.100
Whereas rules is either the check box or yourself.

56
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.200
And then we'll put a little comment there.

57
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.523
Only people with the permission,

58
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.020
can delete themselves.

59
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.710
You can't delete

60
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.883
yourself.

61
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.290
Okay? So there's that.

62
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.500
The next thing is the UI

63
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.890
because we need to be able to hide the UI

64
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.060
from the actual user.

65
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.893
So say UI

66
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.810
here, hide create.

67
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.423
It's going to be args,

68
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.310
bang args.

69
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.350
Oh no.

70
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.450
Permissions dot can

71
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.313
manage.

72
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
So basically this will hide the backend UI from

73
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.530
regular users.

74
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.060
And then we'll hide delete

75
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.053
from them as well.

76
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.270
And that should be good.

77
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.520
Okay, so that's the first step.

78
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.300
Let's save it, reboot our server here.

79
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.843
And go to users, as the logged in user.

80
00:03:34.843 --> 00:03:37.103
Then we'll go to users as the admin.

81
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.713
So users,

82
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.770
and users, there we go.

83
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.760
So now it says,

84
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.150
there is no users found.

85
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.680
That should at least show yourself.

86
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.040
Let's take a look at this again.

87
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.460
Read rules dot can manage users.

88
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.650
Okay.

89
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.574
Oh!

90
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.360
(laughs hysterically)

91
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.000
That makes sense.

92
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.950
We're not...

93
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.460
we don't have an associated user it's just an ID.

94
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.520
So where the ID is equal to the currently logged in user.

95
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.820
So we'll start that again.

96
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.260
While that's loading, we can see that

97
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.600
this one did work though

98
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.463
because the permission does have it.

99
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.293
Here we go.

100
00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.080
There's the one user, but you can see they're all here.

101
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.350
Now we'll go a little bit further and go into the user

102
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.170
and into the role

103
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.535
and we'll say,

104
00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.630
access.

105
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.630
So we want to limit the access of creating a new role

106
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.290
that's associated,

107
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.743
and that is going to be permissions dot can manage users.

108
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.820
So only if you have the checkbox permission

109
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.920
can you create it or update it?

110
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.780
And that should lock it down

111
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.613
for us.

112
00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:55.560
Give that a restart and everything is good to go.

113
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.180
So that is locking down the user.

114
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.140
And that is an example of

115
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.440
being able to lock down a specific

116
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.273
field.

117
00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:03.810
Whether it's a relationship or not,

118
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.810
you can always add access control to an individual field

119
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.703
in addition to, or rather than an entire list.
