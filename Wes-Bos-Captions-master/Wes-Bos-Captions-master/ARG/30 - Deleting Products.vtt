00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.310
<v ->Alright next, let's make a delete button,</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.360
so when you click it will remove the item.

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.980
There's actually kinda two ways you could go about this,

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.220
you could either just delete the item entirely

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.227
or you could change the status of the item

6
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:18.850
to like deleted or that's called a soft delete

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.330
when people are building these things,

8
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.760
sometimes people wanna undelete things,

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.630
while you still need record of the item,

10
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.680
even though it was deleted.

11
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220
In our case I'm gonna show you how to actually delete it

12
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.220
but you could also in make this in update status as well.

13
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.920 line:15% 
So we'll, let's go into our components folder

14
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.690 line:15% 
and we'll make a new file called DeleteProduct.js,

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.380
And I'll say export default function, DeleteProduct

16
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:52.410
and then that will take in the idea of the product

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.761
that needs to be deleted as well as some children

18
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:57.530
because this is gonna be a button

19
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.380
where you can pass anything.

20
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.910
It's just really just a functionality in the button.

21
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.980
From that will return a button.

22
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.980
You have to give a type of a button.

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.813
Get outta here.

24
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.633
And then inside of that, let's just render out children.

25
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.340
We'll go into our product.js component

26
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.660
and right below where we have the edit button

27
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.480
we'll give ourselves our delete product component.

28
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.530
And then inside of that would say delete.

29
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.203
I've got to auto import this sucker.

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.210
Boom.

31
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.410
Let's see, there we go.

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.700
Imported it.

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.030
And now you see we've got

34
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.078
this delete button showing up there.

35
00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:53.590
The reason why we did this children is that

36
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.750
you can literally put anything you want

37
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.090
inside of this button.

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020
So if you want it to feel like a paragraph tag

39
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.440
and another button, I don't think that's possible

40
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.107
but a span, something like that,

41
00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:09.370
You totally can put whatever you want inside of it.

42
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.720
So it's just like a, a little bit flexible.

43
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.420
It's a flexible button.

44
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.040
So it won't bring it back and just say, delete.

45
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.860
Next we need to pass the ID of the item.

46
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.163
And that is product.ID.

47
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
When somebody clicks this button,

48
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.040
you generally with deleting buttons,

49
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.290
you generally want to make sure

50
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.740
that they actually wanted to click it

51
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.050
because if you accidentally click something like that

52
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.447
it could be a bad day.

53
00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:44.430
And there's kinda two ways.

54
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.230
I'll do a delete button.

55
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.750
First I'll just pop up a confirm and that's what we'll do.

56
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.920
But also I have on my own course platform

57
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.180
if I'm deleting somebody or if I'm refunding somebody

58
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.530
what happens is have to click the button once

59
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.350
and it says, click it again.

60
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.183
And you click it twice.

61
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.410
It says you click it twice once more

62
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.680
and you click it three times, it says, all right

63
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.000
we're about to do this, click it one more time.

64
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.290
And we'll actually refund the person.

65
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.240
You click it a third time.

66
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.820
And what that is doing

67
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.400
is it's maintaining a click count of state.

68
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.900
And then only once you've clicked it four times

69
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.760
does it actually run the function?

70
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.280
And that's just a little bit of safety on my end

71
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.910
before you could also throw up a model that says

72
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.090
are you sure to do that?

73
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.350
There's a lot of different approaches

74
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.040
but definitely recommend putting something in place.

75
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040
So on our case, we're gonna give ourselves

76
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.590
an onclick event on the button.

77
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.980
And when somebody clicks

78
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.230
we just run a little inline function right here.

79
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.203
We're going to say if actually here, I'll just do it.

80
00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:55.485
Confirm, are you sure you want to delete this item?

81
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.393
Say, watch this.

82
00:03:58.393 --> 00:03:59.573
So now when you click it,

83
00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.880
this is are you sure you wanna delete it

84
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.060
when you press okay or cancel?

85
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.590
That will return either true or false

86
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.180
depending on what you have clicked.

87
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.100
So we can wrap that in an if statement,

88
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.950
if confirm are you sure you want to delete this item?

89
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.050
Then you wanna go ahead and delete it.

90
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.480
So if someone's presses cancel, then it doesn't matter.

91
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.170
Then nothing will happen on that clicK.

92
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.083
So let's just log out deleting.

93
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.750
Open up our dev tools delete.

94
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.690
Are you sure?

95
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.200
Cancel, nothing happens, delete, okay.

96
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.280
And then we actually get the console log

97
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.633
showing up in there.

98
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.680
This is showing up because it says no restricted globals.

99
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.363
Let's look at that rule real, real quick.

100
00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:56.970
I will probably even configure this to allow for con confirm

101
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.630
because nothing wrong with using a confirm.

102
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.060
It's a really a nice UI that's built right into the browser.

103
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.100
The reason why some people don't like it is that

104
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.190
it will block your entire UI as well as block parts

105
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.060
of your app from running.

106
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.540
But in this case it's not a big deal.

107
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.540
So what we need to do is delete this item.

108
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.380
Then we need to write a mutation

109
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.770
that will actually delete it for us.

110
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.230
So we'll go up here

111
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.460
and we will make a new graph QL query to delete the item.

112
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.460
So I'll say delete

113
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.683
Product

114
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.460
Mutation is equal to GQL Bactec.

115
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.543
So we've got to go ahead and import that.

116
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.560
Import boom.

117
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.480
Sometimes it doesn't auto import maybe that one,

118
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.423
that one worked.

119
00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:57.460
And then in here we need to write our mutation

120
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.790
So we say mutation is,

121
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.750
again, I'll just take the name from here.

122
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.610
And that takes in one variable.

123
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.220
We'll call it ID.

124
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.850
Has a type of ID and is required.

125
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.100
And then from there, like what graph QL method

126
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.270
do we need to run while we can go to our backend here,

127
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.060
go to our API Explorer and let's write a new mutation.

128
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.373
Mutation here.

129
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.370
What does it delete product?

130
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.203
There we go.

131
00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:27.330
Right?

132
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.163
And you can get the docs for that.

133
00:06:28.163 --> 00:06:32.870
By going into the docs here, search for delete product.

134
00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:34.902
Here we go.

135
00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:36.580
It's the mutation takes in an ID.

136
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.900
So here we'll say delete product

137
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.830
pass the ID that was passed as a variable.

138
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.300
And then from that we just return it.

139
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.930
Actually here, you can take a look when you delete it

140
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.160
it returns the product itself,

141
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.900
and it will give you any of the fields

142
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.860
of the deleted item that you wish to have.

143
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.760
So we could query the ID

144
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.963
and the name of the deleted product.

145
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.290
Then we'll go down here and run the mutation.

146
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.290
So we'll go right before our return.

147
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.250
I'll say const

148
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.020
Delete product and comma.

149
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.410
And we want to actually, we don't need to destructure

150
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.990
any of the loading or I'll distructure loading.

151
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.360
You could also get the error from there.

152
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.362
I'll show you another way to get the error as well.

153
00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:28.000
Let's cover all of our bases say muse mutation.

154
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.790
And then you pass it, your delete product mutation

155
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.560
as well as any variables that it needs, right?

156
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.190
So you pass it the actual mutation itself

157
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.710
and then any variables that it needs.

158
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.000
And in our case, it just needs an ID variable.

159
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.020
So we can pass the second argument here and say

160
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.200
if the variables that it needs is the ID property

161
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.710
which is simply the ID that was passed into this component.

162
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.600
And that will just shorten it to just ID again.

163
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.370
I know I say it's a hundred times but look

164
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.010
if it's same thing, I don't want you to be confused.

165
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.843
Save it.

166
00:08:01.843 --> 00:08:04.400
It goes back to just ID cause the property

167
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.680
and the variable name are the same thing.

168
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.560
So now we have this mutation function here.

169
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.270
It's loaded with the mutation, as well as the variable.

170
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.589
We can go here and simply say delete product.

171
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:21.589
And if we want to catch any errors

172
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.360
that happen with that product

173
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.580
in some cases you could destructure the error right here

174
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.890
and that will give you a value.

175
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.800
And you could say, if there's an error

176
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.021
then you could display it.

177
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:34.920
But in our case it's just a button.

178
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.230
So what do you do when there's not enough UI

179
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.343
to show an error.

180
00:08:39.343 --> 00:08:41.250
There's a couple options that we have.

181
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.940
You could pop up a little toaster

182
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.430
in the bottom and sometimes you see these little blue

183
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.520
or whatever items in the corner

184
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.470
and they pop up and say, items successfully deleted.

185
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.760
Or you can just throw it in an alert box

186
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.960
and it was successfully deleted.

187
00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.920
So we're gonna do that.

188
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.960
We'll say delete product.catch.

189
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.550
If there is an error

190
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.110
we will simply just alert the error.message.

191
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.883
Say that something went wrong.

192
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.560
Now what do we got here?

193
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.180
Syntax, error, unexpected name, found dollar sign.

194
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.773
We goofed something up,

195
00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.362
here we go.

196
00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:29.080
We've got to pass the ID prop as the ID variable.

197
00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:38.160
Let's do it with these air max right here.

198
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.480
I'm gonna open up my dev tools.

199
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.230
Just to make sure everything works.

200
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.830
Actually one more thing is this button

201
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.020
we can say disabled is equal to loading.

202
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.520
And that will just disable the button

203
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.120
while it's in the background

204
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.590
cause if you click it multiple times,

205
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.110
you're gonna fire off multiple requests

206
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.290
and we don't want that.

207
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.890
So let's go ahead and click it.

208
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.560
Are you sure?

209
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.100
See for a split second

210
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.970
that button went gray and went ahead and deleted it.

211
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.780
And then we ran the delete product.

212
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.530
Now the product is still there,

213
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.780
but I believe if I were to refresh the page

214
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.020
that should now be gone.

215
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.853
Boom, okay.

216
00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:16.686
That item has gone.

217
00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:21.103
So in the next one we're gonna do is we're gonna figure out,

218
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.660
how do I remove that item?

219
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.490
And there's a couple of ways we could do it.

220
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.320
I've shown you in the past how we can refresh the query

221
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.860
but I'm gonna show you how to go directly

222
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.353
into the Apollo Cash and yank that thing out.
