1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
(light whoosh)
<v Instructor>All right,</v>

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.650
we'll make another rule.

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.990
We're gonna be dealing with the cart,

4
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.720
the orders and the cart items.

5
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.520
So those are three different lists

6
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.060
but they all have the exact same rules,

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.720
this one's pretty simple.

8
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.810
Let's go to the bottom here,

9
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.640
and we'll make a new one called,

10
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.280
actually just go ahead and take the canManageProducts

11
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.040
and duplicate it and we'll call that canOrder

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.230
and then really the only thing we're changing here

13
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.110
and you could probably make an abstraction,

14
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.530
but I prefer to be a little bit more verbose

15
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.403
with this kinda stuff 'cause it's so important.

16
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:36.290
(laughing)

17
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.580
And in this case we're just going to be checking

18
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.950
if the canManageCart

19
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.790
and then if not, then the user

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.068
should only be able to update items that they own

21
00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:55.050
whether that is a cart item or whether that is an order item

22
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.410
or whether that is an actual order itself.

23
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.960
So we have canOrder, and then we'll go into

24
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.880
first one will be cart item and we'll go up here,

25
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.560
and above it we'll say access is going to be an object

26
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:16.561
and can you create a one you have to be is signed in, right?

27
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.650
That's all you need to be able to create a cart item.

28
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.950
Can you read it?

29
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.103
Well yeah, if it rules.canOrder.

30
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.180
Okay in order to update it,

31
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.360
it's going to be rules.canOrder

32
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.560
and if you wanna delete one as well

33
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.460
it's rules.canOrder as well.

34
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.680
Give that a save.

35
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.650
All right, next let's open up order.ts.

36
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.180
And we go and up here, we'll say access

37
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.970
again we'll have our crud

38
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.430
so create, should someone be able to create an order?

39
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.100
Yes, only if they are, is signed in

40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.446
so that is imported there from Access.

41
00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.970
Should someone be able to read an order?

42
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.923
Yeah that is rules.canOrder,

43
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.550
so they should be able to read them all

44
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.460
if they're an admin or they have the permission

45
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.033
or just read their own if they are signed in.

46
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.390
Update is always gonna be false.

47
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.410
So in that case, we just returned false

48
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.550
so you have to do a little arrow function

49
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.210
and return a Boolean false, I believe

50
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.470
the dev say soon you should be able to pass just false,

51
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.280
but for now you have to do a little arrow function

52
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.290
that returns false and then delete is also false.

53
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.140
Then we'll go to orderitem.ts and we'll add the access

54
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.700
and the access will be,

55
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.610
should they be able to create an order item?

56
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.743
Yes, if they are signed in.

57
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.660
Should they be able to update an order item?

58
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.253
No, because they should never be updated.

59
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.003
I forgot read.

60
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:51.860
(laughing)

61
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.130
Should they be able to read in order item?

62
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.850
This is where it gets kinda tricky

63
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.650
because if we take a look at our order item,

64
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.540
you wanna be able to see items that were in your order

65
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.810
if you own that order,

66
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.810
but we never associated a user with an order item.

67
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.200
So two options, you could just add a user to the order item

68
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.610
or in our case, we're just going to...

69
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.450
Because there's already a relationship

70
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.400
between the order we can say okay,

71
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.830
only show me if they're related orders item is,

72
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.240
or sorry, the related orders user is this item.

73
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.280
So what we'll do is we'll make a new rule

74
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.140
and we'll call it canManageOrderItems

75
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.440
and we'll go ahead and write that right now,

76
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.550
so we'll go back to our access.ts

77
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.780
and we'll go just go ahead and duplicate

78
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.330
your entire canOrder rule,

79
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.107
and we'll name that canManageOrderItems

80
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.030
and the only thing we need to change here is that

81
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.860
we're not going to filter it where the order items user is

82
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.190
we're going to filter it where the orders

83
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.230
user is equal to that.

84
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.680
So what we just did there is we take the order item,

85
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.210
we query the order and then we query the related user

86
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.000
and then we check their ID to make sure

87
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.260
that it lines up with what they have.

88
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.190
So we'll go back to our order item here.

89
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.540
So create, signed in read, only theirs

90
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.510
or if you have all the permissions update no,

91
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.283
and delete no.

92
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.180
All right, so that was a lot there.

93
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.450
You definitely need to test this stuff out.

94
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.063
So we'll restart the dashboard here,

95
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.440
and I'm gonna go into my incognito again,

96
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.110
I am in the editor role that we've created.

97
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.767
I'm gonna add a couple things to my cart.

98
00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:43.350
I've just got to wait for Keystone to get up

99
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.600
and running, there we go.

100
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.483
The cart, type in my credit card,

101
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.223
checkout, there we go, it worked.

102
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.770
It allowed me to create an order.

103
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.450
Now the important part is if we go to our back end,

104
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.180
and we look at orders, as this person,

105
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.670
see again I'm in incognito, there's only one

106
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.840
but if I'm in my admin UI here,

107
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.740
I see all of them including the test order

108
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.450
that just went through, same with order items.

109
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.600
I should only see two here

110
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.630
'cause I've only ordered two things.

111
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.080
Whereas this person is an admin,

112
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.370
you can see absolutely everything.

113
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.620
So that's really, really important

114
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.220
that you get that nailed down

115
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.263
and honestly, this is part of what took me,

116
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.870
and honestly, this is part of what takes so long

117
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.240
when building these courses is making sure

118
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.290
you have the stuff nailed down.

119
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.310
'Cause I don't wanna just go kinda hand wavy

120
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.510
at the stuff and say make sure you check it.

121
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.860
Where you might be actually using

122
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.010
a center production application.

123
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.170
So that is our orders,

124
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.483
in the next one we'll get into users.

125
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.830
Hey, I'm just adding one more quick thing onto the end here.

126
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.080
I just thought like, okay

127
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.010
if you try to query all the orders

128
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.230
when you are in a totally signed out state

129
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.220
then you obviously don't get access to them

130
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.053
we took care of that.

131
00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:11.220
But it does throw an error, ideally it should give us a

132
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.200
not like an actual internal server error,

133
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.120
it should give us like an access is not defined.

134
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.070
So what we have to do in those let's do that,

135
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.320
let's do the canOrder right here.

136
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.470
We'll just make another little function

137
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.470
and just say if bang is signed in and pass at the session,

138
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.740
so if they are not signed in

139
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.840
or you could even make a function called

140
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.863
is not signed in, return, false.

141
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.370
And then if we restart our process

142
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.640
now when I run this query, boom

143
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.240
you do not have access to this resource.

144
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.423
So it is worth taking this little once over,

145
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.300
and putting it at the top

146
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.823
of all of your, canOrder, canManageOrderItems,

147
00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:05.900
and canReadProducts put them at the top of all those.

148
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.533
All right, catch you in the next one.
