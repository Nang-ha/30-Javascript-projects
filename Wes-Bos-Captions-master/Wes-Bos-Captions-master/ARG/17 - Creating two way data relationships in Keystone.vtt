00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.210
(whooshing)

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.130
<v Instructor>One thing I really like about Keystone</v>

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.390
is relationships between pieces of data

4
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.700
are really easy to do,

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.910
meaning that if we have a product image,

6
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.870
we should be able to figure out what products

7
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.110
use that image.

8
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.420
And then if we have a product,

9
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.630
it should be very easily to find out

10
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.520
what image is associated with it.

11
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.353
So, it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.107
Sometimes I use these different CMS's and they say like,

13
00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:25.280
"Oh, you can only query the image

14
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.880
if you have the product and not the other way around."

15
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.360
And the whole idea behind two-way data relationships

16
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.840
is you should be able to start at any piece of data

17
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.520
and get all the related data for that.

18
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.180
So, let's go into our product image here

19
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.650
and we're gonna add another field

20
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.170
that is called product.

21
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.760
And that is going to be a relationship field.

22
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.690
And you see how that auto imported right there

23
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.523
up at the top.

24
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:56.093
And you simply just give it a reference to a product.photo.

25
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.410
Why? Because we're going to reference it

26
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.430
to the product data type

27
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.870
and the photo field that is on product.

28
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.920
And we're gonna create that in just a second.

29
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.540
Now, let's open up the other side

30
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.623
which is our product data type.

31
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.900
And we're gonna add another...

32
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.530
Let's do it right in between description and statuses here.

33
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.080
We're going to call it a photo.

34
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.733
And that is a relationship.

35
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.260
See how it auto imported the relationship field right here.

36
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.440
And inside of that, we give it a ref.

37
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.163
And that is going to be referenced

38
00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.313
productimage.product.

39
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.950
You see how in this one we referenced the photo,

40
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620
which is that.

41
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.550
And then in this one we referenced the dot product

42
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.173
which is this field, right?

43
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370
So we have our reference.

44
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.200
And then there's a couple other pieces of data

45
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.900
for the UI in order to get it to show up nicely.

46
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.480
We wanna put the display mode.

47
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.540
It's set to cards,

48
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.200
not a select

49
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.780
because you want to display the image in the alt text

50
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.930
and not just have a dropdown of possible options.

51
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.820
You could, you could change that between cards

52
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.640
and select just to see what the differences

53
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160
between those are.

54
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.270
The card fields.

55
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.190
So when you're editing, like,

56
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.220
what's gonna happen is when we edit a product,

57
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.940
we're gonna get a little UI that's right in line here.

58
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.160
And we're not technically adding fields to our product,

59
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.620
we're actually creating or editing a product image

60
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.250
but we're having a card inside of it.

61
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.300
So we don't have to go to images, upload one, come back

62
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180
select it from a list.

63
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.320
And that's really cool.

64
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.930
So,`which are the fields that we want?

65
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.130
We want the image field.

66
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.883
And we also want the alt text field.

67
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.180
And then there's a couple other things

68
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.233
we have to add here is inline create.

69
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.570
Which fields do we to be able to edit?

70
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.253
And that's the same right here.

71
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.770
And then we finally have one more.

72
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.950
Let's just duplicate that.

73
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.410
It's called inline edit.

74
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.670
And we should be able to do the image and the alt text.

75
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.503
Let's try that.

76
00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:17.140
Last time I tried it, the image didn't work,

77
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.230
but it might be fixed by now.

78
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.310
Let's try it.

79
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.503
So kill it, restart that sucker.

80
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.810
And I'm just gonna refresh this.

81
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.643
There we go.

82
00:03:27.643 --> 00:03:28.476
Create a product image.

83
00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.000
See?

84
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.733
We can upload something.

85
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.350
We'll say Kith

86
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.974
Hoodie.

87
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:39.010
Sometimes this is duplicated

88
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.300
from the name of the product, but that's okay.

89
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.930
And we'll go ahead and just click create product image.

90
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.050
Okay, so that under the hood

91
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.550
is creating a product image.

92
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.950
And then we can go ahead and click save changes.

93
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.980
And now that product image is now related to it.

94
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.010
And I believe if we go to these product images,

95
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.350
we should see it.

96
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.190
It's kind of interesting.

97
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.860
You just see the ID by default.

98
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.133
And you can either add that,

99
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.830
you can add the alt text and...

100
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.240
Oh no, that's filtering.

101
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.073
Here we go.

102
00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:15.170
We wanna add the source, the alt text

103
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.930
and the product to it.

104
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.290
And you can also see information.

105
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.290
You can define what these default field values are,

106
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.770
by going to your product image

107
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.060
and in the fields or in the UI, actually.

108
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.153
There is a field called list view.

109
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.820
And then inside of that, there is initial columns

110
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.020
and you can give it an array of the fields

111
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.640
that you want to show up by default.

112
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.950
So, alt text image or product.

113
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.910
I'm not gonna put that in there

114
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.690
'cause we can easily just check those boxes.

115
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.190
But if this was for a client,

116
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.080
you probably would want to do that.

117
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.140
So, ah, you know what?

118
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.323
Let's do it. Image,

119
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.200
alt text

120
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.453
and product.

121
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.053
Well, you know, I forgot that little comma there.

122
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.959
You see, how like, if I were to spell that wrong,

123
00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.310
like that, it underlines it.

124
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.810
And it says product is not assignable to type image

125
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.940
alt text or product.

126
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.120
Isn't that awesome?

127
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.730
Like, it will take the fields that we created here,

128
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.170
it automatically creates types for us.

129
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.850
And part of types are these things called unions.

130
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.500
And it will tell us what the possible options are.

131
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.850
And it just catches so many, especially for me,

132
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.730
I spell things wrong all the time.

133
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.090
So, that will give you the default.

134
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.210
But we have that here

135
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.060
when we go into this one and edit it.

136
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.510
Oh, and we can-

137
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.120
Let's double check that we can change the image.

138
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.350
Here we go.

139
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.633
Save the changes.

140
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.840
And you can see which product is associated with here.

141
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.063
And then the product,

142
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.260
you can also see which image is associated with whose.

143
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.870
It's a two way data relationship.

144
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.860
I really, really like how slick that is in Keystone.

145
00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.940
Last thing I wanted to test

146
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.530
is does the slide out work?

147
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.283
Description photo?

148
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.390
You can create one.

149
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.740
(laughs happily) There we go.

150
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.670
So, if you want to be able to create data

151
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.960
in this little drawer

152
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.860
instead of in the edit thing,

153
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.150
you can create it and it'll create a second drawer

154
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.550
where you can create it and then it will add it to there.

155
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.383
That doesn't matter

156
00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:23.130
because we're going to be doing this all from the front end

157
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.350
but it's really nice to have a slick UI

158
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.920
to edit and all of that stuff.

159
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.020
So, that is data relationships in Keystone.

160
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.740
We've got a bunch more of those coming up

161
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.090
because we've got cart items and order items and products

162
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.390
and they all have to be related to each other.
