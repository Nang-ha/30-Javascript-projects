00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
<v Wes>Hey, let's get into a navigation</v>

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.680
and a header component.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.970
So that's something that you want pretty often.

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.620
So I already have our page component.

5
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.453
Inside of there,

6
00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:12.440
we're likely gonna have a header component

7
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.680
and a NAV component

8
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.240
and you could have a footer component

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900
anything else that needs to show up on every single page.

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.520
So let's go over to our components folder

11
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.590
and create a new file,

12
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.340
we'll call it capital H, Header.js

13
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.450
and we'll do the whole...

14
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.130
I'm gonna export default function,

15
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.440
capital H header

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.620
and then from that return

17
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.440
and we can return a header tag.

18
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.480
Lowercase means it's HTML tag here.

19
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.100
And then inside of that

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.480
let's just save, I am the header.

21
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.940
Good.

22
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.880
You'll notice that my es link does,

23
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.730
it takes it from this return where it's on the same line

24
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.390
in that and it moves it to,

25
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.790
puts a parentheses around it.

26
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.623
Both will work,

27
00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:57.870
but I just like the formatting of this a little bit better.

28
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.253
Now, what we can do,

29
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.890
is go into our Page.js component

30
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.690
and right above our layout here.

31
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.480
We will use our Header component.

32
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.090
By the way, in here,

33
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.117
when I do that, bong!

34
00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:15.700
Bong!

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.000
What's happening there is

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.040
I am using ess built into vs code.

37
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
As is called Emmett Expand Abbreviation.

38
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.240
And that will expand it out to the tag that it is.

39
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.190
I also have a prettier

40
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.570
as if there's nothing inside of that tag

41
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.750
and I hit save.

42
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.600
It will just change it from an open-close

43
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.710
to a let's call it a self-closing tag.

44
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.440
Again, header is not defined.

45
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.650
So can we import that,

46
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.690
I'll hit my control space.

47
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.850
We'll see that it is trying to auto import it.

48
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.220
So let's go ahead and do that.

49
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.390
You'll see it's showing up right there

50
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.460
and there we go.

51
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.072
I am the header.

52
00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.960
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

53
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.600
So we can close that page down

54
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.560
and let's go into our header here

55
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.130
and we can start templating it out.

56
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.760
So if we take a look at our header here,

57
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.120
we actually have the logo.

58
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.960
We have our NAV

59
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.450
and then we have the search here

60
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910
that will allow us to search for items.

61
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.620
So the markup here is somewhat important.

62
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.160
We'll have our header tag.

63
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.130
And then inside of that

64
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
we have a div with the class of bar

65
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.923
bar.

66
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.920
And it is showing class name here,

67
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.350
sometime in the near future

68
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.521
that we'll be able to do class

69
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:30.173
but right now it is class name.

70
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.070
And below it we need a div with the class of sub-bar

71
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.960
and that will be important for CSS in the future.

72
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.160
And then in there,

73
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.130
you can just say search,

74
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.740
we'll just put a place holder for our search there.

75
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.650
And then that's what's one thing

76
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.410
I don't like about this auto close

77
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.340
is that auto-close closes my div.s for some reason.

78
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.910
So make sure you don't save it

79
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.810
before you put something inside of it.

80
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.990
In there we will have our logo.

81
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.420
Let's just write Sick Fits.

82
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.240
We'll link it up in just a second.

83
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.950
And then below that,

84
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.310
we are going to have our NAV.
Okay.

85
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.770
So the question is,

86
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.900
Is how do you link from page to page?

87
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.270
Well, you might think.
Okay.

88
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.270
I can just do a href=/

89
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.250
and then we'll put our Sick Fits inside of that

90
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.490
and that should work.

91
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.960
Let's go back to our star thing.

92
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.410
Here we go.

93
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.970
And if I go to the sell page

94
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.600
and I click on it,

95
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.490
it actually works.

96
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.190
But what's happening with that,

97
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.270
is that's a regular old link

98
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.350
and that is actually refreshing the page

99
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.050
every single time that you click a page

100
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.650
like a traditional website.

101
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.950
But what we want,

102
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.800
is we want to be able to move from page to page

103
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.520
as fast as possible,

104
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.890
without actually having to refresh the entire page.

105
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.740
And that's one really cool thing that Next. js does,

106
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.940
is that it uses a combination of HTML5 pushstate

107
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.200
which is changing the URL as well as

108
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.100
the ability to trigger

109
00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:09.210
and rerender pages when that URL has changed.

110
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.250
So what we'll do is instead of using a hrefs in here,

111
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.933
what we use is we use the Next. js capital L, link tag.

112
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.050
And then we'll have to go ahead and import that as well.

113
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.720
It doesn't look like it is trying to auto import for me.

114
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.650
So we'll have to do that manually.

115
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.483
Import.

116
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.060
Capital L Link from next/link.

117
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.380
It might have something to do with the fact

118
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.050
that their packages are /,

119
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.540
that it doesn't work.

120
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.480
But now if I go to my /sell page

121
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.663
and I click on it.

122
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.150
You'll see that it linked it right to the homepage.

123
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.340
See it, see how fast that is.

124
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.630
Boom!

125
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.430
Nice and fast.

126
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.500
It is not reloading.

127
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.760
No errors in our console,

128
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.940
no errors in our terminal.

129
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.560
There is a warning here that we're missing our, &lt;Head/&gt;.

130
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.690
That's fine.

131
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.120
We'll be fixing that in just a second in the next video,

132
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.360
when we get into CSS.

133
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.010
So that is our link, previously on Next. js,

134
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.130
we also had to put an anchor link inside of here

135
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.040
but that is not true anymore,

136
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.990
if you're wondering about that.

137
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.200
Let's make another component here

138
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.080
called NAV capital N, Nav.js

139
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.230
and export default function Nav() return from here,

140
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.300
a NAV tag

141
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.560
that's HTML5 nav Tag

142
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.830
and let's think about all the pages that we want.

143
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.540
We want products.

144
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.493
Let's do lowercase products.

145
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.350
What other pages do we have here?

146
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.810
Sell.

147
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.090
So it'll say sell,

148
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.163
orders,

149
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.670
account

150
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.120
and then we eventually are going

151
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.820
to have cart in the NAV here.

152
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.670
So what we're gonna do

153
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.170
is we're gonna wrap all of those in links.

154
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.120
So I'm gonna use the little fast movie action here.

155
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.110
I'm just selecting all the lines.

156
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.950
I hit command shift L to put a cursor on every single line

157
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:19.150
and then I'm going to link

158
00:06:20.258 --> 00:06:24.940
href=/

159
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.890
and then I'm gonna copy that text

160
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.313
and put it inside of there.

161
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.900
Oh, that's not what I wanted.

162
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.113
There we go.

163
00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:36.023
And then I will uppercase the first letter.

164
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.810
Good. And let's...

165
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.830
See like that auto import worked on that one!

166
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.663
Who knows?

167
00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:44.496
Sometimes it works.

168
00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:45.463
Sometimes it doesn't.

169
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.473
Okay.

170
00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:48.920
So our NAV is working.

171
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.590
Let's go into our header and import the NAV.

172
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.270
So you might think, Hey Wes,

173
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.540
why are you not putting this in page .js?

174
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.440
Well, it's gonna be part of the header

175
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.620
so we don't need to put it into page .js.

176
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.070
We just need to import it into our header and use it.

177
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.300
So we'll go right here, say NAV

178
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.713
and we'll import it from our NAV file.

179
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.270
And look at this

180
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.180
account,

181
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.013
orders,

182
00:07:16.013 --> 00:07:17.050
sell.

183
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.560
Boom, boom, boom.

184
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.323
Moving from page to page,

185
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.110
looks awesome!

186
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.440
Okay.
So we've got our Sick Fits,

187
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.490
that's going to be the logo.

188
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.890
We have our search bar

189
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.010
and then we have our NAV,

190
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.750
with all the different items in there.

191
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.210
So any time that you wanna link to something

192
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.360
that is part of your website,

193
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.860
you use the link tag.

194
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.240
Anytime you want to link to something

195
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.880
that is outside of your website,

196
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.260
use a regular, a RAF anchor link.

197
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.740
So that is our NAV and our header.

198
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.250
Let's get writing some styles,

199
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.943
so it doesn't look so awful.
