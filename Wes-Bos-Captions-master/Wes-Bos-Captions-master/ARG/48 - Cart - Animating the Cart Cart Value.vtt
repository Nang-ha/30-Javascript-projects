WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.430
All right now, we need to display the number

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.810
of items that are in the cart.

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.950
And then when that value updates, I want to do some sort

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.910
of animation because it'll show the user

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.060
that this is where they can click their card

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.320
if they want to be able to see it.

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.000
So we'll go and make a new component called a cart count.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.700
So go to components folder.

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.260
Okay. A new file called capital C cart, capital C

10
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.993
count dot JS.

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.970
And in there we'll have an export default function,

12
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.160
cart count, that takes in one prop

13
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.250
which is the number of items in the cart.

14
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.250
And, from that

15
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.250
we will return a dot capital D O T tag

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.780
with the count in it.

17
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.010
Then, we'll make that dot tag.

18
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.570
So a const dot is equal to styled dot div

19
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.910
and we need to import styled.

20
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.743
Good.

21
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.890
And inside of here,

22
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.110
it will say background,

23
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.103
so, var dash dash red,

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.160
color is white.

25
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.440
Let's just stop there

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.810
for a second and actually get it working.

27
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.230
So, we need to implement this into our nav.

28
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.663
So, open up your nav,

29
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.107
and go down to where we are inside of the, "My Cart."

30
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.700
And we'll just give ourselves a cart count

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.513
component, auto import that,

32
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.763
and pass the count as two.

33
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.563
Okay, good.

34
00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:32.370
Let's go back and keep styling it.

35
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.860
Actually, let's hook it up.

36
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.840
Let's hook it up to the, yeah,

37
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.680
we have the cart here.

38
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Basically, we can just say a user dot cart dot reduce,

39
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.710
and we want to take the tally and the cart item

40
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.993
and return the tally plus the cart item dot quantity.

41
00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:59.520
And then we also want to start with zero.

42
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.980
Good, 24.

43
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.860
And now, if we add an item to our cart

44
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.470
that automatically updates to 25

45
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.330
because there's 25 items in the cart.

46
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.163
Beautiful. Okay.

47
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.850
So, that's real data being piped in.

48
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.010
Now, let's go back to doing some CSS here.

49
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.950
We'll say the Brad border radius is 50%.

50
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.693
Padding is 0, 0.5 REM,

51
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.283
line height is two REM,

52
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
the min width three REM, margin left one REM.

53
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.053
Okay.

54
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.633
It's looking a little squished.

55
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.520
Oh, padding.

56
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.690
I bet I put zero.

57
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.810
It should just be 0.5 REM all around.

58
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.680
There we go.

59
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.540
And then, one little thing I like to do is

60
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.853
watch what happens when I add an item to this cart.

61
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.620
You see how it very slightly moves.

62
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.710
It may, because some, like the one, is

63
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.463
if I add an item, the two is much wider.

64
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:08.540
So, it makes the circle go just a little bit wider,

65
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.890
and that can be an issue

66
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.400
if you're counting things up and down.

67
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.300
I often have that on timers on my website

68
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.113
if I'm having a sale on a courses.

69
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.473
So, a way you can get around that

70
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:23.420
is, you say, font feature settings is T num.

71
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.280
That's you mean tabular numb,

72
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280
and font, variant numeric is tabular numb.

73
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.550
So these are just two different browser support.

74
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.570
I'm not sure which one is the most recent or spec,

75
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.350
but just always put them both in,

76
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.620
and you might not even be able to see it here,

77
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.293
but watch when I take it off.

78
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.430
Okay. Let's bump the sucker right up.

79
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.260
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

80
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.400
How big can we go?

81
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.320
There we go.

82
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.083
Watch, when I take this off, watch the width of the two,

83
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.530
see how it gets a little bit wider?

84
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.880
And, as I add items, it gives you just a little bit

85
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.260
of a shift and that's kind of annoying.

86
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.940
So that will, regardless, that makes all numbers

87
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.900
the exact same width.

88
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.440
That's what, at the end of the day, I'm trying to say.

89
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.800
Okay, so we have the My Cart item being updated.

90
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.990
Next, what I want to do is show you how to do some very

91
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.460
basic animation in here,

92
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.560
so that when it updates

93
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.400
we can animate it.

94
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.370
And that is with using a package called

95
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.630
React Transition Group.

96
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.610
So, we'll go in here,

97
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.570
and we will wrap this in a transition group

98
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.033
Tag.

99
00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.053
So put the dot inside of there,

100
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.020
and we've got to import transition group.

101
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.950
Okay,

102
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.950
and then we also need a CSS transition

103
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.013
tag,

104
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.943
and then we'll put the dot inside of that.

105
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.220
Now the CSS transition tag takes a number of props.

106
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.700
One is called "unmount on exit,"

107
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.967
and the next one is called "class name."

108
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.293
That's count.

109
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.670
There's also class names.

110
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.580
And I'll show you what that is in just a second.

111
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.833
That has also count.

112
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.810
Then we have key,

113
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.780
and this will tell it when to update itself.

114
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.570
And the key will be based on the count.

115
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.040
That's the thing that changes.

116
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.020
And then the timeout is going to be curly brackets

117
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.473
and object enter, will take 400 milliseconds,

118
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.330
and exit will take 400 milliseconds.

119
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.730
So, now, watch what happens.

120
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.030
I'm gonna open my dev tools here

121
00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:49.330
and watch what happens down here.

122
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.530
When I add an item, adding to cart, boom.

123
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.053
Now there was two of them.

124
00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:59.950
Let's change that from 400 to five thousand.

125
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.690
So, what's going to happen is we're going to go

126
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.400
from 35 all the way up to 36.

127
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.750
So, what's going to happen is it's going to duplicate it.

128
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.810
It's going to show us the new component,

129
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.910
which is 36, as well as the old one.

130
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.450
And then it will put classes on them,

131
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.600
which allow us to animate them out and in

132
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.490
which is really cool.

133
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.600
So watch, I'm going to add an item here.

134
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.310
Boom. You see, look at this,

135
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.680
36 is count interactive and count exit active.

136
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.130
And then, after five seconds

137
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.870
they remove those classes and say, this one is done.

138
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.260
So just by adding and removing those classes

139
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.070
we'll be able to hook onto them

140
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.500
with CSS and do some kind of neat CSS animation.

141
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.567
So, we're going to go up here

142
00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:48.567
and we'll say const animation styles is equal to,

143
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.623
a style dot span,

144
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.023
And in here we'll say position relative.

145
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.430
And, we'll say, dot count,

146
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.373
enter, transform.

147
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.970
Actually, let's just do this,

148
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.670
background green, dot count,

149
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.430
enter active background

150
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.750
Yellow, dot count, exit, background, blue

151
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.950
And dot count, exit active, background pink.

152
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.373
Now watch, when I add an item here,

153
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.490
oh, we don't get them yet,

154
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.210
'cause we haven't used this animation styles yet.

155
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.900
We've got to wrap our entire component

156
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.840
in these animation styles.

157
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.440
Just so that they'll be applied.

158
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.720
And now when I add a new item, so look at that,

159
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.410
yellow, pink, and after a split second: boom,

160
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.540
they go back to where they were.

161
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.080
So, we're obviously not going to change the color of them,

162
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.460
but we are going to change the value of where they are.

163
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.400
So first, we're just going to select them all,

164
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.690
which is dot count.

165
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.800
That's where the class name comes in handy.

166
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.370
The class names is the count dash.

167
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.053
That's how we do that one.

168
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.883
I'll say display, block, position relative, transition.

169
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.610
We want to transition on the transform property

170
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.660
over 0.4 seconds.

171
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.130
It's really important that you line up this value right here

172
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.760
with the value that is here.

173
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.330
So, we'll change that back to 400 milliseconds

174
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.483
in just a sec, and then back face, visibility,

175
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.240
is going to be hidden, and this is because

176
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.190
we can flip them, if you want.

177
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.023
You can flip them.

178
00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:03.120
And as they flip out, you don't want to show the back

179
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.953
of them.

180
00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.910
Maybe as they want to flip out into nothing

181
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.180
Then, count enter is going to be transformed

182
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.653
Scale four,

183
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.283
and rotate.

184
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.860
We want to rotate it half a turn, or rotate X.

185
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.870
And if you want to rotate something half,

186
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.480
you can do 180 degrees.

187
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.280
Or, I found out recently, you can just use your 0.5 turn.

188
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.310
Whereas one turn will be a full trip.

189
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.050
A half a turn is half a turn.

190
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.760
I really like using turn units.

191
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.580
Then, when it is active, we will say rotate

192
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.623
X, zero.

193
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.970
And, the count exit, we have to say top zero,

194
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.830
Position absolute because we want it to go

195
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.610
on top of the existing one

196
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.240
and transform rotate X zero.

197
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.380
So, that's the initial state.

198
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.980
And then the opposite

199
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.610
of the initial state is the active state,

200
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.910
where we will do the exact same thing as this.

201
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.823
So now, watch this, add to cart.

202
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.980
Boom, boom, boom.

203
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.963
So, we can turn these back down to 400.

204
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.080
And then as you add an item

205
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.170
it gives us that nice little, whoo.

206
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.340
You can even change the color of it,

207
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.273
as it is entering background green.

208
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.480
And then that will turn it green as it is animating in.

209
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.320
So, you can just like, anytime you get like tripped

210
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.590
up over what these classes are, just throw a color

211
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.790
or a border and crank up the time-outs,

212
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.640
just make sure that you do match the timeout right here.

213
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.900
And then you'll be able to see what is happening

214
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.100
in slow motion.

215
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.590
So, I really liked that.

216
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.900
That's a really slick way to do some basic animations.

217
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.600
That's not for more involved animations.

218
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.850
But, at a very basic level,

219
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.850
you can duplicate your components and apply animation styles

220
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.520
to the one that is leaving,

221
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.480
as well as animation styles to the one that is entering.

222
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.100
And the reason why we have double

223
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.240
for each is that you have to transform from something

224
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.060
to something else, you can't just transform to scale

225
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.370
four and rotate X.

226
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.470
So, what happens is it gives it a class

227
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.250
of count enter and then a millisecond later

228
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.940
it gives it a class, a class of count interactive.

229
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.310
You can't even see the difference

230
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.620
in the dev tools because it's so fast.

231
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.380
But basically, that allows us to have a transform

232
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.810
from A to B.

233
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.720
And because we are transitioning between them,

234
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.250
it'll look like an animation, same thing with this

235
00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.150
you start here, and you transfer to here,

236
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.990
and I take away that background as well.

237
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.830
So, that is the animation part of our cart.

238
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.680
If I do have one more challenge to you,

239
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.430
is that when somebody, adds an item to a cart,

240
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.440
try to also automatically open the cart using

241
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.353
that context method that we previously used.
