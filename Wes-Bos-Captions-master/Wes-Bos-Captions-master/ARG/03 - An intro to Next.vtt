00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.510
<v ->Let's talk about Next.js</v>

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.640
So Next.js is a framework for building websites

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.280
and apps with React.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.870
So React is a library that basically all React

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.040
does is it takes your data and it puts it

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.630
into templates and it renders that out to the page.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.370
And when your data changes

8
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.690
it will update the thing on the page.

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.523
That's it.

10
00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:22.630
And in the Next.js an entire framework.

11
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.349
It does routing linking from page to page lazy loading.

12
00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.100
It's starting to do images now

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.310
which is really cool at the server side rendering.

14
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.060
So you can render React on the server.

15
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.150
It does static for pre rendering

16
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.880
does a whole bunch of really cool stuff.

17
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.700
And it's just a really slick framework

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.197
for creating a website or an app.

19
00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:44.520
What I've got open here is I've gone into the front-end

20
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.630
directory of our, of what we're working with.

21
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.820
And then I've opened that up in our vs code.

22
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.110
And you're gonna see a whole bunch of folders in here.

23
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.810
And I know some of you are thinking West don't

24
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.550
give me too much starter files.

25
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610
I wanna be able to code it myself.

26
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.100
I wanna a refund.

27
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.020
Well, there's nothing in here.

28
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.220
There's a couple of styles

29
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.650
which is we're not gonna sit here

30
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.350
and write the CSS all day where we will write some

31
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
of the CSS, the lib, nothing in there, node modules

32
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.030
that's everything we NPM installed pages, nothing in there.

33
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.354
These gitkeep files are just so

34
00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:19.010
that I can put an empty folder into, into get

35
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.843
what else do we got here?

36
00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:20.940
We got our public.

37
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.700
There's a favicon, which is that a little bit

38
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.560
of CSS for one of the plugins we're using

39
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.470
and then a font that we're using on the website.

40
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.520
And that is it.

41
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.720
And that's what I really like about Next.js

42
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.749
is that you can just create pages

43
00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.170
and then it will go ahead and work.

44
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.610
So let's go into our pages director here

45
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.633
and I'm gonna make an index.js.

46
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.200
And you'll notice that I did a lowercase I on there

47
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.060
normally when we create components in React

48
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.220
we put a capital on there

49
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.040
and that's because that denotes them as reusable components.

50
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.900
In this case, it's just a page.

51
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.720
And that index js will be

52
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.320
are very similar to how HTML works.

53
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.970
So it'd be our index HTML.

54
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.670
And then what you do in each

55
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.080
of your pages is you export a React function.

56
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.300
And that will be what shows up on the page.

57
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.100
So if we say export default function, and in here

58
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.870
we'll just return &lt;div&gt;.

59
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.000
And we'll put a paragraph that says hello in it.

60
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.360
Now, in order to start it, let's take a look

61
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360
at our package.jason, and we'll go to our scripts.

62
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.720
You'll see we've got a dev, which is our dev command.

63
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.730
We have our build command

64
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.130
which is what you run before you deploy it.

65
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.210
You have your start command

66
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.600
which is what you use to run it on

67
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
and production that goes on your server.

68
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.690
And then we have a testing

69
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.100
and sometimes there's gonna be other

70
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.410
you might not see these by now.

71
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.790
It depends on what we do by the end of the course.

72
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.900
So in order to run it, you simply

73
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.530
you've already gone and done NPM install, right?

74
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.434
And then we run NPM run dev

75
00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:56.670
and that will in turn, run next.

76
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.147
I'm running it on port 7777, open it up.

77
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:05.147
It takes a real quick second to sort a start up next.js.

78
00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:06.950
And there you go.

79
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.200
You see, we have hello in there.

80
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.670
So the pages in Next.js are

81
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.730
they do what's called file system based routing.

82
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.790
If you've taken, maybe one of my I'm a beginner

83
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.020
JavaScript course where we use React redder.

84
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.030
That is like config based where we have like a

85
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.730
a rack rudder component.

86
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.030
And in this case

87
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.000
we simply just create a page and the page will show up.

88
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.610
So if we take a look at our other versions here

89
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.470
we've got our index page, we've got our products page.

90
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.180
We have our cell page, we have our orders page.

91
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.540
We have our account page and that is it.

92
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.870
So let's go ahead and make those really quickly.

93
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.820
Oh, one more thing.

94
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.360
Actually, what I should do is this is currently

95
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.770
an anonymous function and we should name that just so that

96
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.030
if we ever have debugging errors that it's actually named

97
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.820
so we'll call it index page or homepage.

98
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.830
It doesn't matter what you call it.

99
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.490
It's just great for, for debugging.

100
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.240
So I'm gonna go ahead and make a new page.

101
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.376 line:15% 
We'll call it, sell.js and you just take the cop copy

102
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:14.376 line:15% 
paste and change that index page to sell.

103
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.830
And there are snippets that you can get that will sort

104
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.685
of make this much faster.

105
00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.700
I think it's like rack component.

106
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.980
Yeah. See something like that.

107
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.929
That is a React snippet one.

108
00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:29.270
I'm just gonna to type or copy paste it.

109
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.592
So don't email me asking me why I'm not using those.

110
00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:36.104
Let's also just save that one as

111
00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:41.104 line:15% 
orders.js was that orders let's double check.

112
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.710
Yep. And we also have another one called account.

113
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.840
Actually, let's change this.

114
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.780
We forgot. Let's change it to order page.

115
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.103 line:15% 
Let's change this one to account.js.

116
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.870 line:15% 
And I believe that is all.

117
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.970
We need also need products.

118
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.600 line:15% 
So we'll save the last one as products.js

119
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.303
Okay.

120
00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:12.480
So what we've done there is we've created all of our pages.

121
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.340
And now if we go

122
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.340
to four slash account or four slash products

123
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.400
you'll see that it is up and running.

124
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.120
One really neat thing that Next.js does is it

125
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.220
has hot reloading.

126
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.050
So if we were to change this to Hey and give it a save

127
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.070
you'll see it immediately changes that happens

128
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.480
with our CSS and our JavaScript.

129
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.260
So very rarely on the front-end

130
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.750
will we need to go back to our terminal

131
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.752
and kill it and start it again

132
00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:42.640
just because it will always hot reload it.

133
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.390
It will also give you a really nice little error messages.

134
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.590
Remember I forgot the name, the function here.

135
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.538
It gives us this really nice air messages

136
00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:52.640
like, Hey, it works, but probably a good idea

137
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.020
in order to get better debugging message.

138
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.192
Give it a name.

139
00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:59.470
So I'm a big fan of that.

140
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.780
Other things we need to know

141
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.260
about Next.js is that it is server rendered.

142
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.360
Meaning that if you go to a Next.js website

143
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.180
and you were to view source on it, and this is not true

144
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.270
in development mode, but this is true in production mode.

145
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.180
If you were to right click view source, you would see all

146
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.920
of the HTML for the rendered out production version of that.

147
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.630
And then what happens is that React will come

148
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.140
and rehydrate on the front-end.

149
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.930
So if you go to westboss.com/about here

150
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.486
let me show you a real quick example

151
00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:36.560
see this value right here.

152
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.130
This is a React component that is incrementing

153
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.650
how many milliseconds I've been a developer.

154
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.500
And that just every couple of milliseconds,

155
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.510
it will then update.

156
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.490
It's often re render that part of the page.

157
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.960
Now, if you were to view source on this, is it exactly.

158
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.003
Here we go.

159
00:06:56.003 --> 00:06:59.910
See it says exactly six six one, one or whatever.

160
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.410
And that's awesome because that is good for SEO.

161
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.550
And that will render it out.

162
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.740
If someone has JavaScript turned

163
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.260
off or someone scrapes the page

164
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.322
or Google crawls it or something like that.

165
00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:13.890
So that's the server rendered aspect of JavaScript.

166
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.130
And then when it gets to the client

167
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.520
which is the browser React, we'll pick it

168
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.050
up from there or Next.js year we'll pick it up from there

169
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.880
and then make it a React application.

170
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.350
That's gonna give us really slick, like page transitions.

171
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.690
You see, like here, if I go from page to page

172
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.630
this is not actually reloading the page.

173
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.920
It's just swapping out the content that we see.

174
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.539
And that's one of the really nice things that Next.js does.

175
00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.030
Other things we need to know about Next.js

176
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.020
Is that it is server rendered, like I said

177
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.330
but it also can be statically rendered, meaning that

178
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.330
at build time you could possibly re pre-render these pages

179
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.841
so that they load really, really quickly.

180
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.047
Like, let me show you an example.

181
00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:01.210
Let me click on, on this one right here.

182
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.520
I've never been to it before.

183
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.920
See it took, it was really quick, but it took a split second

184
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.930
because it had to go to the database and bring the data back

185
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.120
data back and then render it out to the page.

186
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.300
What you could do is you could pre-render this whole thing.

187
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.660
This is called statically, render it.

188
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.990
And then when someone visits this page, it will have already

189
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.220
been made into HTML.

190
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.280
And it just makes your website that much faster.

191
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.700
So you can opt into server, rendering

192
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.970
Or static rendering.

193
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.020
There are three different hooks called get static props

194
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.100
get server-side props

195
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.720
and get initial props for data fetching.

196
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.020
We'll get into that in the future

197
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.939
but just know sort of that's how it works for now.

198
00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:45.510
I think that's good, very, very high level intro

199
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.680
of what Next.js does in the next couple of videos

200
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.403
we'll get into linking and styling and all that good stuff.
