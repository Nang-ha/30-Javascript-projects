00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
<v Instructor>All right,</v>

2
00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:03.630
we're going to get a little bit meta.

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.440
We're going to create roles and permissions for

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.061
managing access to roles and permissions.

5
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:14.700
Before we do that, let's just make a secondary role.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490
Let's just call that,

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.373
Editor.

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.450
And the editor can delete an update,

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.863
query users, edit users,

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.820
and let's say, that's it.

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.890
And we'll assign that to uees,

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460
create the role just so that we have it.

13
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.990
So now I'm right here.

14
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.290
This is me as just a regular website user.

15
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.010
If I go to roles,

16
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.210
you see I'm able to actually see them.

17
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.840
I'm able to edit them.

18
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.110
I'm able to change who they're assigned to all that.

19
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.080
And I shouldn't be able to do that as a regular user.

20
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.440
So we need to lock that down.

21
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.800
Well, let's open up our list, which is role.ts.

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.710
And we'll go up here

23
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.260
and there there's a couple of things that need to happen.

24
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.020
We need hard access,

25
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.800
as also we need to hide the UI from the user.

26
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
So say access,

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.850
right here.

28
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.393
So create as permissions.

29
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.060
I imported that from my access file

30
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.460
and that is, can manage roles.

31
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.300
I mean literally the rest are going to be the same

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.190
create, read, update, and delete,

33
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.570
all have access to that.

34
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300
If they're all the same I believe

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.720
you can also just pass it

36
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.360
to access in general

37
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520
because they're all the same

38
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.900
but I much prefer to just have it like this

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.840
so that if I do need to manage it, I can do that.

40
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.640
So if I give that a save now

41
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.780
and restart the process.

42
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.000
We see now

43
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.749
there are no roles to be found for this person

44
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.960
because they do not have that permission

45
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.147
but there still is this UI here that they're like,

46
00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:49.370
"Hmm what's a role," right?

47
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.470
Like, I didn't even know that was the thing, right?

48
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.690
So we also can take it a step further

49
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.680
and say the UI.

50
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.300
And then in the UI property here,

51
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.710
we can say there is hide create,

52
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.993
which can be done like this.

53
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.663
It is

54
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.690
we can do a little function, which is args.

55
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.580
And then we'll just return the opposite

56
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.590
of permissions.canManageRoles

57
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.670
and pass the args here.

58
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.730
And then there's another one called hideDelete.

59
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.173
And then there's another one called isHidden.

60
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.500
And if you hover over top of them,

61
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.440
exclude this list from the admin UI

62
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.560
and then hides the delete button in the admin UI

63
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.900
note that this is not disabled deleting items

64
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.890
through the graphQL API only hides it.

65
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.690
So it's really important that you don't just

66
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.360
hide the buttons from them

67
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.360
but you first actually limit their access control.

68
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.220
And then you go and

69
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.370
hide the buttons from them.

70
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.530
So it makes sense to them.

71
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.900
They don't, they're not seeing that.

72
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.290
So now give this a kill restart

73
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.840
and now it's not even in the sidebar

74
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.590
I guess it's still shows the roles here, but

75
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.423
now if you click it,

76
00:03:03.423 --> 00:03:05.830
there's no way to get to that specific UI.

77
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.913
So that is role-based permission.

78
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.680
In the next video, we'll pick it up with a few more types.
