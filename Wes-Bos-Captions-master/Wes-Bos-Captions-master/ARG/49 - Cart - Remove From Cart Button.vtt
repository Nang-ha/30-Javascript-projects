1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.930
<v Wes>Now we're gonna have the remove</v>

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.713
from cart button coded up.

3
00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:06.660
And I think the very basics of this

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.350
you could be able to try yourself.

5
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.210
And that's what we're gonna cover in this video

6
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.950
is creating a button, creating the mutation.

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.610
The mutation that we're gonna be using

8
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.610
is called delete cart items.

9
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.820
So, and there's no custom mutations or anything right here.

10
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.850
We're simply just using the built-in Keystone API.

11
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
We'll do that.

12
00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:26.830
So try do that on your own.

13
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.310
And then in the next couple of videos

14
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.650
we're also gonna look at some more advanced Apollo Features,

15
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.970
which is update our functions,

16
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.010
and what's called optimistic responses.

17
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.140
So that like you don't necessarily have to wait

18
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.110
for the query to re fetch when you delete it.

19
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.810
It just immediately will show you that it's been deleted.

20
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.100
So let's get going here.

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.610
We'll go into our components here

22
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.733
and we'll make a new component called,

23
00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:54.323
RemoveFromCart.js.

24
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.363
In here, export default function, remove from cart.

25
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.130
And that will take in the ID of the cart item

26
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.660
that needs to be deleted.

27
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.510
And then from that

28
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
we will return a button that has a times in it.

29
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.270
And then when you use something like that,

30
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.360
that's gonna read to your screener as multiplication sign.

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.193
So what we'll do here

32
00:01:24.193 --> 00:01:25.980
is we'll put a title on that button that says,

33
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.720
remove this item from cart, okay.

34
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.240
Now it's giving me grief

35
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.633
because I forgot to add the type of button, okay.

36
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.800
Then let's do a little bit of CSS.

37
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.633
We'll say,

38
00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.623
we'll make a new styled component called big button,

39
00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.023
is equal to style.button.

40
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.523
We'll import the styled attribute here.

41
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.870
And we'll go in there and we'll say font size

42
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.677
three REM, background, none, border zero.

43
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.243
And I'm gonna say, when it is hovered,

44
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:15.237
so end hover, the color is going to be red

45
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.690
and the cursor is a pointer

46
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.230
and we'll go here and place this button with our big button.

47
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.063
And then we'll go into our cart.js component.

48
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.970
And we'll go into our singular cart item.

49
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.810
And right below that closing div

50
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.280
we will put our remove from cart button,

51
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.680
will auto import that

52
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.810
and then it gets past the ID, which is the product.

53
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.923
No, not product, it's the cartitem.id.

54
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.020
Okay, cool.

55
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.853
Looking good.

56
00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:04.740
We've got all of our X's showing up, which is great.

57
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.600
Next we'll code up our mutation.

58
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600
So const remove from cart mutation is equal to GQL.

59
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.803
Go ahead and import that.

60
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.677
And the mutation that we delete

61
00:03:20.677 --> 00:03:24.350
is called delete cart item that takes in an ID variable

62
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.440
with the type of ID and that is required.

63
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.570
And then from that

64
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.020
we will run actually, usually I, sorry, excuse me.

65
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.900
I usually call that remove for cart mutation.

66
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.130
And then here, it's called delete cart item.

67
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.620
This is the thing that lives in our Keystone API

68
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.010
and will pass an ID, which is the ID variable.

69
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.047
And then what we get back is simply just the ID

70
00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:47.750
of the deleted item.

71
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.530
And we're gonna need that because we want to remove it

72
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.960
from the cache without having to go back to the server

73
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.683
and re fetch the entire users cart.

74
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.810
Now we'll go up here and then we'll say,

75
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
const remove from cart and loading is equal to use mutation.

76
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.060
And we, I auto imported that by the way

77
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.350
we pass it our remove from cart mutation

78
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.680
and then the variables that we pass

79
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.883
it's going to be simply just the ID variable.

80
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.823
And I did something wrong here.

81
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.280
What did I do wrong?

82
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.863
Unexpected comma.

83
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.963
Oh, I forgot one more curly bracket, that's why.

84
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.470
There we go.

85
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.280
So now when somebody clicks on this button

86
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.150
we will run the remove from cart button.

87
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.150
So let's say on click is equal to remove from cart.

88
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.700
And then also we'll just say disabled,

89
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.570
that's equal to loading.

90
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.330
So the person can't fire off multiple

91
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.113
or remove from cart mutations.

92
00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:11.070
All right, I think that should be enough

93
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.610
for the very basics of it.

94
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.650
So we'll try to remove this Yeti Hondo from our cart.

95
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.990
Let's open up our Dev tools just to make sure X

96
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.210
and, now visually nothing has happened.

97
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.823
If I give it a refresh, is it still in our cart?

98
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:30.960
No, it's no longer in there.

99
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.240
Okay, so that has successfully worked.

100
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.310
In the next video, what we're gonna do is we have to,

101
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.044
we normally, we could do something like this,

102
00:05:40.044 --> 00:05:40.930
like re fetch queries

103
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.920
and then we could just give it the user query

104
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.420
and it would re fetch the current user's cart

105
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.790
and then that thing would update

106
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.550
but that's not always the solution that you want.

107
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.150
So I'll say more about that in the next video.

108
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.710
We'll visually show the item being removed

109
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.953
from the cart with optimistic responses.
