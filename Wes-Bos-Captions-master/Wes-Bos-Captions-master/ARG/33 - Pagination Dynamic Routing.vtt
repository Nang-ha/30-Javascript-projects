00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
(whoosing)

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.040
All right, let's talk about "Dynamic Routing".

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.870
So right now we just have products

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.690
and we need to be able to filter them.

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.420
So just something like products

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.970
we could either do query string,

7
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.920
which is like Page is equal to 2.

8
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.110
Oh, let me bring this into here.

9
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.270
So we can do something like that.

10
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.180
That is called query string routing.

11
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.570
And what that does is it just renders

12
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.270
the same product every single time

13
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.570
but passes us a little bit of differential along with it.

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.490
And then we could also do like file based routing

15
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.603
index js, which is /products/2.

16
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.960
Quite honestly, I think this looks better.

17
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.980
This is more for when you have like

18
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.690
multiple query PARAMs

19
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.240
that you you don't necessarily know

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.350
what they're going to be.

21
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.080
Search, Filter, things like that.

22
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.300
This is a little bit nicer in my opinion.

23
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.680
So in order to do that,

24
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.940
we've kind of already done it.

25
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.950
We've done /product/id.js.

26
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.820
We're just going to do that again

27
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.180
and I'll show you how to do it.

28
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.640
So we are going to make a Folder,

29
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.640
so new Folder and we're going to call it Products, okay?

30
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.900
And then inside of that

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.660
we need a New File that is going to be called Square

32
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.527
and then page.js.

33
00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.630
And you can call this whatever you want.

34
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.749
Like previously we called it id.js

35
00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.610
but this is what the variable will be called

36
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.780
when it's passed to you via the query PARAM.

37
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.750
Now we have a bit of an issue

38
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.300
in that we have a products that's js

39
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.720
and we have a products/page.

40
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.590
So if we were to export default products page

41
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.713
you don't have to do this or just return.

42
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.790
Let's just return something from that

43
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.303
just to see if this works turn and P, Hey.

44
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.050
Export default function products page there we go.

45
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.517
Now, if we go to products/2,

46
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.020
we get, Hey

47
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.440
you go back to products,

48
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.640
Oh, it actually still works.

49
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.648
I didn't think that would work.

50
00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.130
(laughs)
It does.

51
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.130
So you can either keep this as products.js,

52
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.480
or you can put it as an index in this products right here.

53
00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.189
And I don't know which one I like better.

54
00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.640
(groans) See I don't like naming files index.js,

55
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.230
because it's not so descriptive to me.

56
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.910
And if you were to open up multiple index jss

57
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.510
you just have multiple indexes in here.

58
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.680
It will tell you what Folder it's in, in VS Code.

59
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.338
But I like naming my stuff, what it is.

60
00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:49.170
But the other flip side to that is

61
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.200
I kind of like having them in the same Folder

62
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.640
because if I'm looking at the page /products

63
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.970
then I know that that's where it is.

64
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.930
So I think we should move it.

65
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.400
And we're going to have to rename it

66
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.070
from products js to index js

67
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.160
but I think we can do it.

68
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.050
Now, so I'm going to take this here,

69
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.890
drag and drop it in there.

70
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.487
And it's going to ask us, are you sure you want to move?

71
00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.090
And you say yes, Move.

72
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.020
And then it should ask us if we want to update imports,

73
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.950
there we go.

74
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.920
Update imports for product.js

75
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.060
because we've changed the directory structure.

76
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.000
And now everything we imported is is that a different level.

77
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.373
So we're going to say Yes.

78
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.250
And let's just double-check that this right here

79
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.980
you see how these, if it didn't work for you

80
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.580
you will see just one level up, something like that.

81
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.820
But if it did work for you,

82
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.930
you see we go two levels up

83
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.363
in order to get the things that we need.

84
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.670
Okay, good.

85
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.070
Then the last thing we need to do

86
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.490
is just rename that to index.js.

87
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.323
So here's the other thing

88
00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:53.200
is our index page is now importing this.

89
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.930
So we need to update those as well.

90
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.763
I'll show you how to do that

91
00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:57.260
if you're not using VS Code.

92
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.150
Click Yes

93
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.020
and if you look at your main index.js File

94
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.583
which is right here,

95
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.380
you'll see that it is actually the import is the same,

96
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.850
but it would look like this,

97
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.450
but because of imports you can just do it like that.

98
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.540
All right let's see if this is working.

99
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.390
No we've got our broken products.js

100
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.113
no pages for products.js, okay.

101
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.043
That makes sense

102
00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:33.250
because we don't have a products.js anymore.

103
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.500
We have a products/index.js.

104
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.210
So maybe this is one of the cases

105
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.993
where we need to restart it.

106
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.933
Yeah, let's try go and restart the whole process.

107
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.003
There we go.

108
00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:57.836
That worked.

109
00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:00.750
Okay, so we just had to restart the process after that.

110
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.000
So the important thing here is that our index js

111
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.640
is importing

112
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.701
the index such as file from the products Folder.

113
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.020
And normally it would look like something like this

114
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.190
but because it's named index

115
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.910
you can simply just import the Folder.

116
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.200
And then in here we are saying

117
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.040
render out index such as when it's on the main page.

118
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.300
And then if we go to /products/3

119
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.530
we're now rendering out this page.

120
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.564
So let's work in here.

121
00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:37.660
Now what we want to do is

122
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.820
we basically just want to do the same thing

123
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820
we did on our Homepage

124
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.860
which is export the products here.

125
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.830
So it will say export.

126
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.590
So I'll say export

127
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.810
default

128
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.643
from

129
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.653
and it is index.

130
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.663
Is that work?

131
00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:00.739
It does.

132
00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:01.930
Okay, so that might be a little bit confusing.

133
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.810
So what's happening here is that

134
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.650
we want the same thing to render out

135
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.639
on three different URLs, right?

136
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.320
This is file based routing at its finest

137
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.870
is we've got three different files

138
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.850
but they're all rendering out the same thing.

139
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.970
Our index page right here,

140
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.500
our page route right here

141
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.360
as well as our /products main page.

142
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.130
When somebody doesn't pass the page number

143
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.100
and we are just defining what happens in one file

144
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.740
and the other ones are simply just pointing to it.

145
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.720
So what we can now do is we should be able to access

146
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.420
the current page value by accessing our router.

147
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.253
So we'll go in here.

148
00:06:43.253 --> 00:06:44.086
We'll say const

149
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.720
let's just say router is equal to use router.

150
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.820
And this is a hook that comes with next js.

151
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.940
I can import it.

152
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.280
So import use router from next js

153
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.163
And we should be able to, there we go.

154
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.523
Console log.

155
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.500
The router itself.

156
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.920
And you see our router has all kinds of stuff in it.

157
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.310
As-Path, back, events

158
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.590
is-Fallback, locales

159
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.470
pre-fetch blah, blah blah, blah, blah.

160
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.917
The important part we need is this the query.

161
00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:27.910
And you see, it gives us the page number.

162
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.410
That page value comes because we named our file

163
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.170
square brackets page.

164
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.580
And the same thing It is a query.id

165
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.750
because we named it square bracket id.

166
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.970
So here we can just go

167
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.120
and let's destructure the query

168
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.523
that's directly off but use router.

169
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.300
And then here we can say,

170
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.100
the page is equal to the query.page or 1.

171
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.190
And then what that will do is

172
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.260
if there is no page path to the query,

173
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.970
meaning that we're on the Homepage

174
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.760
or we're on the products page,

175
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.340
then we'll default to one.

176
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.840
Otherwise we're on /products/2

177
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.640
and it should work.

178
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.170
So we'll do that the same here

179
00:08:11.543 --> 00:08:12.376
and pass it there.

180
00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:13.740
You probably could also

181
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.730
Yeah, you could probably also

182
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.080
just query this right inside of the pagination.

183
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.070
I don't necessarily see a reason

184
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.240
why you would have to pass it in.

185
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.070
So you could put that inside of the pagination as well.

186
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.050
I'll keep it like that just to show you,

187
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.900
I think the reason why we did that is

188
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.210
these hooks used to only be available at a page level

189
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.043
and not the hooks,

190
00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:39.530
but you could only access the query at a page level

191
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.840
and you had to pass it in

192
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.320
but you can use this use router hook

193
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.433
anywhere you want which is really slick.

194
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.770
So do these, URLs work now next?

195
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.950
Yeah, look at this.

196
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.963
Oh no, (laughing) that is not working.

197
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.870
So if I refresh page one of seven,

198
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.815
I click on Next page 11
(laughing)

199
00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:06.980
Extra points if you can find out what happened here.

200
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.820
So we were on page one

201
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.660
And you click on Next

202
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.890
then we get to page 11.

203
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.540
Well, let's go into the pagination, take a look here.

204
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.660
Page is probably

205
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.570
being ah! pages a string, right?

206
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.080
Like if you have a string of one and you add one,

207
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.020
you get 11 right?

208
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.200
And if we have that so we were concatenating

209
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.430
not actually adding.

210
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.280
And I bet that is because

211
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.180
it's either being passed in as a string.

212
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.803
Let's go back to our products page here.

213
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.810
I'll show you how to find that out.

214
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.667
Log query.page.

215
00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:04.610
So it's black so it's a string,

216
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.390
but if you weren't sure

217
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.380
you could also just like log out and like a real number.

218
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.220
And you could see that that number is green

219
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.360
or whatever colors in Chrome DevTools

220
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.660
or you can check it, you can say type of

221
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.260
and it will tell you it's a string and not a number.

222
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.880
So what we want to do is we'll say const page

223
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.827
is equal to parse.

224
00:10:25.827 --> 00:10:28.620
It is an Int because it's a whole number

225
00:10:31.624 --> 00:10:34.370
And then would say type of page.

226
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.760
And then if you pass not query.page

227
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.973
but just page here,

228
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.060
that should now work.

229
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.513
So you see it type of is now a number.

230
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.800
And if we go to page one and click on Next

231
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.750
and now it goes two, three, four, five, six, seven

232
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.920
and then the next button is grayed out

233
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.710
go all the way back to the Homepage.

234
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.060
And the previous button is grayed out.

235
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.860
Awesome, so that is getting the query variable

236
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.230
and doing our dynamic routing

237
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.170
in the last video we'll do is we'll pass that value

238
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.860
over to our products query

239
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.423
and be able to filter for the ones that we want.
