00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:01.480
(bright music)

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.313
<v Instructor>This will be a quick one.</v>

3
00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:04.050
We just need to get our nav looking pretty good.

4
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.280
So first the nav needs to go alongside the logo.

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.980
So if you move the nav up to the logo

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.710
that is going to put the items right there.

7
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.540
Then let's open up our nav.js

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.010
and we are going to replace just the nav tag

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.190
with our nav style.

10
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.450
So if we take a look at the nav styles

11
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.400
I've supplied to you,

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.240
you'll see that it is a

13
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
styled.ul

14
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.890
and there's all kinds of different styles in here

15
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.100
that's gonna make it look good.

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.350
So let's go in here

17
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.640
and we'll say nav styles

18
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.510
that one auto imported.

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.513
Give it a save.

20
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.293
Boom.

21
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.050
And it looks like it's goofing up a little bit,

22
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.960
not what we exactly wanted.

23
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.573
Let's open up our header styles real quick.

24
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.550
All right, here we have this bar,

25
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.230
let's debug it together.

26
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.220
CSS Grid and Flexbox.

27
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.260
So we've got this bar here

28
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.093
and

29
00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:10.140
it is

30
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.760
moved into two parts.

31
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.030
We have auto, which is however big the header needs to be

32
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.800
and then 1fr, which is the rest of the space

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.270
you see the, that's being sliced right there, that's good.

34
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.260
We want all the space to be the nav.

35
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.710
We got that

36
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.810
and then we have this UL.

37
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.240
So looks to me like this UL is not,

38
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.280
see the height of it.

39
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.420
The height of it should stretch all the way across.

40
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.620
So if we go back to this bar here

41
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.300
and we say align

42
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.630
items

43
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.990
center.

44
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.730
I think it should be align item stretch

45
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.940
and that will stretch it above.

46
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.033
So lets go back to our here, stretch.

47
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.320
Beautiful

48
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.060
looking good.

49
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.810
All right, we got that item showing up.

50
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.820
Let's move on to the next one

51
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.410
which is actually selling items on this page

52
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.680
and being able to add products

53
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.623
from the front end, like a user would.
