00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:02.900
(whooshing)

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.100
<v Wes>Hey folks, Wes here.</v>

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.450
Hopefully you are stoked to get started

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.870
on the Advanced React course.

5
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.840
I am gonna use this video as a chance

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.963
to get all of your tooling

7
00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:14.840
and starter files and everything on your computer

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.380
so that this tutorial will run smoothly for you.

9
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.700
Now, I know some of you may already have this set up.

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.070
Maybe you've done one of my tutorials before.

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.700
So I'm gonna rattle off really quickly,

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.380
I'm gonna rattle off what you need.

13
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.940
And then I'm gonna go into why and how and what not.

14
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.940
And you just listen to me rattle it off

15
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.997
and say, "I got it, Wes,"

16
00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:36.830
then you can skip it.

17
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.760
From there you can move on to the next video.

18
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.580
So real quick, you need the latest Node.js.

19
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.220
Probably whatever's on the LTS,

20
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.290
14 point whatever at the time.

21
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.650
It might be version 20 by the time you're listening to this.

22
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.810
The browser, I'm using Firefox here.

23
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.069
You can use Chrome.

24
00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.640
I believe you can also use Safari.

25
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.920
The Dev Tools that are for React and Apollo I believe

26
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.270
are available on all of 'em.

27
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.160
You need MongoDB Compass, which is a little app

28
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.560
that allows you to visualize your database.

29
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.070
I am gonna be using VS Code.

30
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.800
I'll talk about why and how in just a bit.

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.370
So some sort of editor.

32
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.470
You need some sort of terminal.

33
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.470
And that is it for the tooling.

34
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.810
Then you also need to grab the starter files.

35
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.490
So if you go to your course dashboard,

36
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.000
you'll see a link that says Starter Files.

37
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.720
You'll click over to the GitHub

38
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.230
and there will be a sick-fits folder in there.

39
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.020
In that we have a backend and frontend folder.

40
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.460
Those will give you your starter files.

41
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.840
I'll talk more about them as we get into it

42
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.420
but again, it's very similar to every single course

43
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.040
that we've had.

44
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.530
So that's the quick and dirty of it all.

45
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.240
Let's go into it a little bit more.

46
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.830
The first one being Node.js.

47
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.740
You need a modern version of Node.js.

48
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.470
So in my case, if you don't even know

49
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.520
if you have Node.js installed or what version,

50
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.540
you can just go and open up a terminal application.

51
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.590
I'll talk about that in a second and type node -v.

52
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.130
And that'll tell you which version

53
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.290
of Node you are currently on.

54
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.750
As long as it is somewhere above what this is.

55
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.500
It might be version 25 by the time you're watching this.

56
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.690
It comes out I think monthly or something like that.

57
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.270
They bump the version number.

58
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.690
So don't be stressed if it's version 130.

59
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.299
You go, "Oh my gosh, that's a lot."

60
00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.770
So that's how you can tell you have that

61
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.100
and then you can type npm -v

62
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.080
and that'll tell you which version of npm you are on.

63
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.560
If you are a Yarn head,

64
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.360
you can use Yarn for this tutorial.

65
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.350
It should just work properly.

66
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.710
I will be using npm for this.

67
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.840
What else have we got here?

68
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.130
You need two browser extensions.

69
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.700
You need the React Dev Tools

70
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.640
and you need the Apollo Dev Tools.

71
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.010
So React Dev Tools,

72
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.000
just find it for your browser, install it.

73
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.190
Apollo Dev Tools, they are currently working,

74
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.280
as I record this, they're working on a huge overhaul

75
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.113
to the Dev Tools.

76
00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:55.340
So it might look a little bit different

77
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.070
or a lot of it different than what you see here.

78
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.010
But you just need the Apollo Dev Tools

79
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.633
and the functionality will be the same.

80
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.340
Next, we need MongoDB Compass.

81
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.940
So MongoDB Compass is a GUI desktop app

82
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.670
that will allow us to visualize the data in our database.

83
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.770
So you'll see here I'm connected to my database

84
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.860
that we're gonna be creating.

85
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.960
If you open up your, let's see items

86
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.020
and take a look here,

87
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.370
we've got, look, these are all of the items that we have

88
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.203
and all the data.

89
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.260
So this can be helpful

90
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.530
if you wanna like manually change something straight

91
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.710
in the database before you have a GUI.

92
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.950
I really love this tool.

93
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.440
I use it for all of my MongoDB applications.

94
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.490
So ahead and go to the, just google MongoDB Compass,

95
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.950
click on try it now

96
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.550
and then follow the steps in order to download it

97
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.550
for whatever operating system you're on.

98
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.470
Editor, I'm using VS Code for this one

99
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.920
and usually I say it doesn't matter what one you use

100
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.160
but the integrations between linting

101
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.040
and type hinting and all that stuff is so good in VS Code,

102
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.810
so obviously, you can use whatever you want

103
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.040
but a lot of the nifty tricks that I do

104
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.910
will be VS Code specific.

105
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.890
So you can go ahead and grab that.

106
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.610
The theme I'm using is called Cobalt two.

107
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.920
Also, when you open up these projects,

108
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.483
so when you go ahead and grab the starter files,

109
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.744
you'll see that we have backend and frontend.

110
00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:26.560
The way that we're gonna be doing this course

111
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.570
is we're gonna open each, the backend and the frontend

112
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.750
in different VS Code windows

113
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.540
and that allows us to have a different mental separation

114
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.510
between the two code bases.

115
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.130
And I have purposefully color coded them.

116
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.950
So if I were to open up the backend,

117
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.920
you'll see that it is pink

118
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.540
and the frontend is going to be yellow.

119
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.117
And that will just visually show you

120
00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:53.010
when I'm editing a file,

121
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.860
even which part of the application am I working in?

122
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.722
When you open it up,

123
00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:01.190
it will suggest to you a list of extensions

124
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.963
that you might want to install.

125
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.980
I would recommend installing those.

126
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.710
You'll see a list of them in here.

127
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.680
You should see a little thing

128
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.670
on the bottom right-hand corner

129
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.980
if you don't already have all of these installed.

130
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.340
And these are just little settings

131
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.340
and things that I use to make my VS Code work well for React

132
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.323
and Node development.

133
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.270
Last thing, you need a terminal.

134
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.550
So a terminal is available already on your computer.

135
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.160
But I'm using one here called Hyper.

136
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.060
There's another really good one for the Mac called iTerm2.

137
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.080
There also is a built-in one.

138
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.730
All of this fancy mancy stuff right here is,

139
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.170
this is called Zeta Stage.

140
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.940
Absolutely not required

141
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.130
for the tutorial but if you do want it

142
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.410
to match how I have it here,

143
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.510
you can go to my wesbos.com/uses

144
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.240
and that will list off all of the configs

145
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.730
and what not that I am using in this tutorial.

146
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.020
So if you wanna get it looking exactly the same.

147
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.210
Not get too hung up on that though

148
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.060
'cause we're here to learn React

149
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.853
and not fiddle around with our tools all day long.

150
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.840
If you're on Windows,

151
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.710
I highly recommend you check out WSL,

152
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.070
Windows Subsystem for Linux.

153
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.890
And what that will do basically

154
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.569
is it gives you a terminal

155
00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.350
that runs in Windows

156
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.670
but without all the tiers

157
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.880
and all of the commands,

158
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.010
everything that we do in Mac and Linux land

159
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.675
will just work properly on Windows land.

160
00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:36.620
It's not 100% required.

161
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.727
You can do this tutorial with the built-in terminal

162
00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:43.727
in Windows but it's just frustrating to work with

163
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.300
just because a lot of things don't work the same way

164
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.430
and you hit a bunch of bumps and bruises.

165
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.110
So since this is an advanced tutorial,

166
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.970
I'm not gonna go over how to install that or what not.

167
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.042
There's lots of tutorials out there, how to get it.

168
00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:01.500
But that would definitely be a recommendation from me.

169
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.750
Last thing that we need to do here

170
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.220
is to run npm install on both of our folders.

171
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.160
So if we take a look here,

172
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.840
we have our backend and frontend folders.

173
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.454
What I like to do is keep open two tabs

174
00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:17.000
and move into my Advanced-React into sick-fits.

175
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.163
So you can either clone the repo or download it.

176
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.900
And in here, you will have both of your folders.

177
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.360
I'm gonna go into the backend on one of them

178
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.960
and into the frontend on another.

179
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.820
And then you just run npm install

180
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.200
on each of these folders

181
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.710
and that will go into the paakage.json file

182
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.070
and it's going to take all of the dependencies

183
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.650
that are needed, both for building the application,

184
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.969
as well as developing it.

185
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.251
And go ahead off and grab them.

186
00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:56.730
If you, and you will, if you see errors

187
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.950
about security warnings or everything warning,

188
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.480
it won't work or something is out of date,

189
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.620
unfortunately, that's just par for the course

190
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.300
with React and with JavaScript in general.

191
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.970
Don't sweat it, stick to the versions that are in here

192
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.000
because that is what the tutorial has been recorded with.

193
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.010
You can try upgrade them if you want

194
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.782
but you're more than likely going to run into issues

195
00:08:23.782 --> 00:08:24.615
and what not.

196
00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:26.030
So for the sake of learning,

197
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.050
stick with what you've got here in the dependencies

198
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.900
and I will keep this list of dependencies up to date

199
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.310
with everything that is needed.

200
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.740
When you run your npm install,

201
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.530
you will see 5,000 things stream across.

202
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.530
Like right here, I'm using React 17 for this

203
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.650
and a lot of my dependencies

204
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.890
haven't been updated for React 17.

205
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.830
Even though they worked,

206
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.070
they're gonna just puke a whole bunch

207
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.190
of stuff kind of thing.

208
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.233
Unfortunately, that's totally normal.

209
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.763
What have we got here?

210
00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:53.923
140 vulnerabilities.

211
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.790
I updated this thing like three hours ago

212
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.887
or something like that

213
00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:02.450
and this may seem really scary and it is

214
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.397
and you should definitely look into it but don't freak out.

215
00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:08.866
Almost always this is actually not a big deal.

216
00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:11.290
So don't stop the tutorial if you see something like that.

217
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.850
I literally updated this thing like a couple hours ago

218
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.491
and it's probably one little small vulnerability

219
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.670
that is used in 140 different of the packages

220
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.930
and they all will have to be updated.

221
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.000
So I know that sounds weird for me to say

222
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.980
but trust me on that, it's probably fine.

223
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.330
I think that's it for all of my setup.

224
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.493
Let's get into the next video.
