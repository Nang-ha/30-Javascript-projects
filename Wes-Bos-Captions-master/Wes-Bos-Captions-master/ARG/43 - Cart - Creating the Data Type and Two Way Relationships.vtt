00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:01.671
<v Instructor>All right,</v>

2
00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:02.550
let's start working with the cart now.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.049
So we're obviously gonna be able to add things

4
00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.180
to our cart and display what's in our cart

5
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.940
and add up the total and all that good stuff.

6
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.840
But before we do that, we need to work on the backend

7
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.510
and create a new data type, that is a cart item.

8
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.570
So the way that it's gonna work is we have a user

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.200
and a user has a cart.

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.510
That's just gonna be a field on our user.

11
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.690
Whoever the items in the user's cart are going to

12
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.980
be this new data type that's referred to as cart items.

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.430
And if I take a look at like a cart item, like, right here

14
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.263
it's going to have a product

15
00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:38.222
which is a link to an existing product.

16
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.270
And then we are also gonna have a user which has a link

17
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.018
to a user, and then we'll have a quantity, which is how many

18
00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:51.018
of that product does the user have in their cart.

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.630
So let's go into our schemas and let's take Product.ts

20
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.310
and let's just duplicate that.

21
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.850
So I'm gonna to save it as capital C Cart

22
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.220 line:15% 
capital I Item.ts

23
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.023 line:15% 
And we will rename this to CartItem.

24
00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:13.720
And what do we got here?

25
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.030
We got our fields.

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.320
So we don't need...

27
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.990
we can get rid of all the fields that are in there.

28
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.990
So essentially just a new Keystone list where the fields are

29
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:29.840
well, first thing is we want the quantity.

30
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.790
How many of these items will they have?

31
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.603
And that is going to be an integer.

32
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.170
So we have to, oh, it already auto imported

33
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.250
but you see how it's importing

34
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.346
from Keystone fields right here.

35
00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:44.685
Then inside of that integer, we want a couple options.

36
00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:49.685
We wanna say the default value is 1 and is it required?

37
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.460
And that is true.

38
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
Then another field that we want is the product

39
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.211
that we are linking to

40
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.220
and that is going to be a relationship.

41
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.260
And the reference is going to be the name of the data type.

42
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.850
So if we look at our capital P Product

43
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.380
that's this one right here.

44
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.845
So we name it capital P Product.

45
00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:15.845
And then the user is going to have a reference

46
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.130
of User.cart.

47
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.590
So what we're saying here is we're gonna

48
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.130
have a two way relationship where a cart item will link

49
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.382
to a user and a user will link to cart items.

50
00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.773
And that way we have a two-way relationship where

51
00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:33.660
we don't have to always update them on one side or another.

52
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.060
Some CMS has make you do that, but in Keystone

53
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.047
you don't have to.

54
00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:40.170
And okay, so that's the default we want there.

55
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.380
We also want...

56
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.920
We're just gonna put a quick little to do custom label

57
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.019
in here 'cause the label is just gonna give us the ID

58
00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.683
of the cart item.

59
00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.219
And that isn't very, very helpful.

60
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.430
So we go back into our Keystone.ts

61
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.610
and go to where we have created our schema.

62
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.700
We have our user, our product, our product image,

63
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.413
now we're gonna to have our CartItem.

64
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.460
I just hit Enter there when it auto suggested it

65
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.800
and it went ahead and imported the cart item

66
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.110
from our schema there.

67
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.320
Next thing we want to do is go into our User.ts

68
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.390
and we need to add our cart field to the user.

69
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.770
So we'll go right below where we put the password here.

70
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.630
And we'll say the user's cart is going to be a relationship.

71
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.180
The reference is going to be a CartItem.user.

72
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.870
So see how we're doing a two-way relationship here.

73
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.710
The user is referenced to user.cart

74
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.600
and then the cart is a relation to CartItem.user.

75
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.950
And that's how we get that two-way relationship.

76
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.710
We can say many is true, meaning that the user

77
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.957
can have multiple relationships to cart items.

78
00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.960
You wanna have multiple things in your cart.

79
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.610
Then the UI value that we have here is createview

80
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.230
is field mode will be a string of hidden

81
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.670
and item view field mode of read.

82
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.650
And we'll see what that is in just a sec.

83
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.930
All right, so what we just did there

84
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.910
is we created a new data type called CartItem.

85
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.920
We updated our user and then we imported that CartItem

86
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.060
into our schema.

87
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.693
Now, if we restart our backend.

88
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.020
We should now see that the Cart Item data type shows up

89
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.193
in our sidebar here.

90
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.140
There we go, Cart Item.

91
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.240
You can go ahead and create a new cart item,

92
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080
quantity of 3.

93
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.080
We can link to the Yeti cooler on which user will have that.

94
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.580
And then click on Create, Oh, I think the click set

95
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.974
Wes boss, and then click Create Item, there we go.

96
00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:04.810
And then here we see that that is our cart item.

97
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.030
If we go down to a list of the cart items

98
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.863
you're going to see that.

99
00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:08.764
(instructor laughing)

100
00:05:08.764 --> 00:05:10.720
What does this mean to me?

101
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.510
Right? And you can select the product

102
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.252
and the quantity and the user.

103
00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:19.340
And you can see these things are now showing

104
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.158
up ID, Quantity, Product, User.

105
00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:25.800
We can make those show up by default by going to our list.

106
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.983
And we'll say UI.

107
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.100
And then inside of the UI you can see what options you have.

108
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.460
By just hitting Option + Space or no Control+ Space.

109
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.800
And it will give you all the possible properties

110
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.410
that are in here, no need to go to the docs.

111
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.710
That's really, really cool.

112
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.760
And you can see in here, create view, hide, create, hide

113
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.860
delete is hidden item view, label, view, list view.

114
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.550
So we go to list view, cause that's this view right here.

115
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.882
And then inside the list view we say initial columns

116
00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:56.924
and the initial columns is.

117
00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.770
I think we give it a.

118
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.290
Here we go, oh, look at that.

119
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.660
This is, this is why you like using TypeScript.

120
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.500
So you look at it just

121
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.170
auto-populates the fields that are possible in here.

122
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.800
You don't have to type it or copy paste like a sucker.

123
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.890
So the product, the quantity

124
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.379
and user is what we want initially to show up.

125
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:19.810
I don't know if that will change

126
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.430
because I've since changed it myself by doing this.

127
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.980 line:15% 
But that is a good thing to have

128
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.100
'cause that's one less email you're gonna get

129
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.087
from your client and being like,

130
00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:31.100
"Hey I can't see any data

131
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.280
about the things in the cart item."

132
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.270
This is not necessarily something you're gonna

133
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.450
be managing a user's cart with, but it's good

134
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.010
to show anyway, have some really nice defaults.

135
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.099
So that is our initial creating of the cart item value.

136
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.153
And let's get into the next one.
