00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.593
<v Instructor>All right.</v>

2
00:00:02.593 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's work on pagination now.

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.630
So we've got however many items

4
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.463
they're just dumped

5
00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:07.450
onto this one page

6
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.230
or onto the products page.

7
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.430
We see all of them.

8
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.263
We want to be able

9
00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:12.750
to have like four

10
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810
or three or 10 per page.

11
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.900
And then we want a listing

12
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.980
of how many possible pages there are.

13
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.310
So I've just written out

14
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.490
sort of like the approach

15
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.323
that we'll take

16
00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.010
to build this pagination is

17
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.860
let's just like first

18
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.000
render the actual link

19
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.641
so that we can click to them.

20
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.170
And then that will 404

21
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.003
because those pages

22
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:30.836
won't be available.

23
00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:31.669
So we'll do the next

24
00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.950
is we'll make dynamic routing

25
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.010
where products forward slash one

26
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.440
or products four slash two,

27
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.160
et cetera like that.

28
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.450
Then the third thing is

29
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.220
we need to filter the products

30
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.053
on the current page.

31
00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:44.470
So if we're on page two

32
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.740
and we're showing two per page

33
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.573
then we need to show

34
00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:48.270
these two right here

35
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.300
instead of the first two right there.

36
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.620
And then finally,

37
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.453
the toughest one

38
00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:54.298
is dealing with the cash.

39
00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:56.480
Like what happens when you have

40
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920
three pages loaded into the cash?

41
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.180
And then all of a sudden

42
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.270
you delete an item on page two

43
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.070
or you add an item on page one,

44
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.120
things get bumped either way.

45
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.830
We'll look at how to tackle that.

46
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.900
So let's go and make a new component.

47
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.733
We'll go into

48
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.340 line:15% 
our components folder here,

49
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.440 line:15% 
make a new file.

50
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.813 line:15% 
Let's call that a pagination.js.

51
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.740
And we will export

52
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.523
default function pagination,

53
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.830
that will take in what page

54
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.343
we are currently on.

55
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.200
And then from that,

56
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.560
we will first let's actually

57
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.640
just deal with the SEO

58
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.480
part of this cause I'm sick

59
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.150
of having just local hosts on there.

60
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
So we have a head,

61
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.440
we'll have a title tag

62
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.123
I'll say sick fits page.

63
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.203
And then we'll pass the page.

64
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.480
We don't need that dollar sign of

65
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.313
and then we'll say

66
00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:58.800
of the total number

67
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.530
that we have here.

68
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.240
And then we also need

69
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.710
the pagination styles.

70
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.970
We'll wrap everything in that.

71
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.343
So pagination styles.

72
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.870
And these things need to be imported.

73
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.800
So the head needs to be imported.

74
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.080
It doesn't look like an auto import.

75
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.140
So we'll do it ourselves.

76
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.580
So import head from next head

77
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.660
and then the pagination styles.

78
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.610
That one's not wanting to import either.

79
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.840
Let's go into our styles.

80
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.823
Here we go.

81
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.350
Import pagination styles

82
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.413
from styles, pagination styles.

83
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.110
Okay, now we need to,

84
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.190
let's start to render out.

85
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.850
Oh, I forgot to put a return

86
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.770
in front of here.

87
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.800
Oh, here we go.

88
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.550
Let's go to our page that renders

89
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.700
all of these items

90
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.290
and we'll pop one above

91
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.370
and one below it.

92
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.650
So that is in our index,

93
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.010
which our index is simply

94
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.763
just importing it from our products.

95
00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:10.150
Here we go.

96
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.983
And in here,

97
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:12.963
we will render out our pagination.

98
00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:15.709
And the kind of

99
00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.100
the cool thing about that

100
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.180
is we can actually put one

101
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.560
below the products as well.

102
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.350
And all we need to do

103
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.430
is pass it that one prop,

104
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.710
which is our page

105
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.140
and then the page is going

106
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.020
to be passed in

107
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.240
via the query prams.

108
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.930
Right now, we don't know

109
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.000
which page that is.

110
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.870
So what we'll do is

111
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.053
we'll just hard-code page one.

112
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.340
All right, so back to

113
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.520
our pagination component,

114
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.950
we need a couple of things.

115
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.783
We need a link

116
00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:45.616
to the previous page.

117
00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:47.570
We need a link to the next page.

118
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.030
We need how many total pages there are

119
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.220
and what current page we are on.

120
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.670
So let's go ahead and do that.

121
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.670
We need the link from next jazz

122
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.940
and we'll import that,

123
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.010
there we go,

124
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.630
that one imported.

125
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.320
And here we're just do an arrow Prev,

126
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.310
these little arrows that I do,

127
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.870
these are just Unicode arrows.

128
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.170
If you Google Unicode arrow,

129
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.270
you should find them.

130
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.990
I have a little shortcut to arrow, arrow

131
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.590
and arrow arrow just because

132
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.010
I like using these arrows

133
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.542
and tweets and emails

134
00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:24.520
and things like that.

135
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.890
So we have our prev,

136
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.640
we have our next

137
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.720
then inside of here

138
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.660
we have page underscore, underscore

139
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.743
of underscore underscore,

140
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.410
and then we need to also tell it

141
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.013
how many items total.

142
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.930
Oh, failed prop.

143
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.950
The prop pref expects a string.

144
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.860
Oh yeah.

145
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.650
We forgot to pass that.

146
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.950
We don't have those numbers yet.

147
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.963
So let's just,

148
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.280
just put it to forward slash.

149
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.113
Okay, cool.

150
00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:00.580
So now we have our pagination here.

151
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.520
We have our previous,

152
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.353
we have our next,

153
00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:03.320
how many pages we have

154
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.210
in our items total.

155
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.730
So I think the first thing

156
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.420
we need to do is

157
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.810
in order to calculate,

158
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.220
how many pages do you have?

159
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.950
You need two pieces of information.

160
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.160
How many items are there in total

161
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.070
and how many per page

162
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.820
are we working with?

163
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.030
So to get the total number of items

164
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.200
we can write a little query for that.

165
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.260
If we go to our backend again,

166
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.960
go to our API Explorer here,

167
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.200
we can write ourselves a little query

168
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.950
that says sign like query.

169
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.070
And if we want to query

170
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.814
like all products

171
00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:38.100
and then we wrote the ID,

172
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.230
that's not really scalable

173
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.640
because this will literally return

174
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.460
to you an ID of every single product.

175
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.113
So what happens if you have

176
00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.049
6,000 products, right?

177
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:49.900
You can't make a request.

178
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.733
You can,

179
00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:52.680
but that'll be megabytes of IDs.

180
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.470
And we don't necessarily want that.

181
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.720
So Keystone actually provides us

182
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.320
with meta queries.

183
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.230
They start with underscore

184
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.770
and you say all

185
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.260
and you see there's all users meta,

186
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.290
all products meta,

187
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.730
and all product images.

188
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.640
Every single type that you have

189
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.760
it will give you the metadata about it.

190
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.593
So in our case,

191
00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:12.100
it's all products meta.

192
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.950
And then in there,

193
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.030
really the only thing that you

194
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.710
can query is the count.

195
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.127
So now if we run that,

196
00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.910
you'll see we get the actual

197
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.743
how many products

198
00:06:19.743 --> 00:06:20.576
are in the database.

199
00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:21.910
And then we no longer need

200
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.160
to query every single product.

201
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.260
We can simply just ask

202
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.370
for how many are in there.

203
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.020
So we can go back here

204
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.770
and do the whole song

205
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.250
and dance again of making a query.

206
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.490
So const pagination.

207
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.109
Oh, I've gotta spell it right.

208
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:38.723
Underscore query is equal to GQL.

209
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.453
Boom, imported it.

210
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.090
And here query

211
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.090
and wait, you know what?

212
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.061
Let's just copy this.

213
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:50.020
What are we,

214
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.356
what are we writing stuff

215
00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:53.690
like suckers for that

216
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.830
we already wrote it.

217
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.390
Okay, there's no variables

218
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.860
or anything that needs to go there.

219
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.693
In this case,

220
00:06:58.693 --> 00:06:59.590
you don't need to name the query

221
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.640
since there's no arguments or variables,

222
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.890
but you can just

223
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.190
put that in there as well.

224
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.490
Then if we want that data,

225
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.950
I simply just go here.

226
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.950
Say const, if error loading data

227
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.400
is equal to use query

228
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.233
and then you pass it,

229
00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:19.270
your pagination query

230
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.853
we need to import use query.

231
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.193
And there's that right there.

232
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.543
And we'll just say,

233
00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:30.903
if loading return,

234
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.750
you can return null

235
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.370
if you want nothing to render

236
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.220
or you can return

237
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.160
loading dot, dot, dot

238
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.290
depends on what you want to show.

239
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.760
Same thing for the error.

240
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.040
We can return our error.

241
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.210
What did we call it?

242
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.813
Error, error message, yeah.

243
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.580
So what we're going

244
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.650
to import it up here

245
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.980
and return it's not error,

246
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.263
it's display error.

247
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.810
And then we got a pass,

248
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.400
the actual error itself as props

249
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.000
which is error.

250
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.430
All right, so with that,

251
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.180
we should be able to have the data

252
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.490
and we can go into here

253
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.800
and say page

254
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.103
or not page items.

255
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.063
So it should be able

256
00:08:20.063 --> 00:08:21.850
to interpolate how many items

257
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.170
there are just data

258
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.253
dot count items total.

259
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.303
Go back to our actual application here.

260
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.680
And it just has items total.

261
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.180
So maybe it's not working

262
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.013
for whatever reason.

263
00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:36.846
So it would just go ahead

264
00:08:36.846 --> 00:08:38.900
and log out our data,

265
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.280
see what we're working with here.

266
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.080
Oh yeah, it's .allproductmeta.count.

267
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.740
So what I'll do is

268
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.963
let's just make a little const.

269
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.440
We'll make a little variable up here

270
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.810
count is equal to data

271
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.433
dot all products meta.

272
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.733
And then here,

273
00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:03.000
we can just use the count variable

274
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.170
because we're gonna need that one

275
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.720
many times over,

276
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.553
there we go,

277
00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:07.550
13 items total.

278
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.880
Okay, so that's the first thing.

279
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.127
Second thing is

280
00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:11.580
how many pages are there?

281
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.920
Well, you have to know

282
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.970
how many are going

283
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.840
to be done per page.

284
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.960
And it's best not

285
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.860
to hard-code that type of value

286
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.170
in your calculations,

287
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.003
because if you ever need

288
00:09:22.003 --> 00:09:22.836
to change that,

289
00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:23.730
or even if you want your user

290
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.823
to change how many per page

291
00:09:24.823 --> 00:09:26.240
then it needs to be stored

292
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.660
in a variable somewhere.

293
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.870
So I am going to stick it

294
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.140
in our config

295
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.090
and look, we've already done that.

296
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.680
So expert cons per page

297
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.170
is equal to four.

298
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.290
And if we go back here,

299
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.863
we can import that value.

300
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.690
So import per page from,

301
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.903
we've got to go up a level into config.

302
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.190
And then if we want to know

303
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.240
how many pages there are,

304
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.570
we say const page count is equal to

305
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.760
you take the actual count

306
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.800
and divide it by how many

307
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.610
we are viewing per page.

308
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.570
And then we can take

309
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.670
that underscore here

310
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.480
and pop in the page count.

311
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.251
Now, that's gonna give us a decimal

312
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:18.067
because sometimes you have

313
00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:20.380
not a full page of them.

314
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.300
So what we need to do

315
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.640
is we need to get the upper bound.

316
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.650
You don't want around that

317
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.940
because there's always gonna,

318
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.820
even if there's just like

319
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.450
one item on the last page,

320
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.710
like there is in this case

321
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.040
there still needs to be

322
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.410
a last page to show that.

323
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.950
So what you do is wrap that

324
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.990
in math that ceil

325
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.440
and that will give us

326
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.480
the upper bound of that

327
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.503
to the next whole number.

328
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.124
There we go.

329
00:10:44.124 --> 00:10:45.670
So page four.

330
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.740
Now, if we change that value to two

331
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.310
that number of pages

332
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.300
goes up to seven.

333
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.810
You see, oh, I love,

334
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.850
love doing stuff like this

335
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.300
because look at how,

336
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.370
how quick it will update itself.

337
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.393
See if you have 10 per page,

338
00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.540
it's only two pages.

339
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.860
So let's, let's do it on two.

340
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.190
That way when you delete items

341
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.840
you still have the pagination

342
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.570
working pretty well.

343
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.490
Last thing we want to do

344
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.650
is we'll take this page value here

345
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.870
and that's being passed in.

346
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.980
So page whatever of count.

347
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.240
So that's defaulting to just one

348
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.110
because we are hard coding

349
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.150
passing it right here

350
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.390
but we'll make that dynamic

351
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.710
in just a second.

352
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.530
You see, we have page one of seven

353
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.710
being popped up.

354
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.050
So what we can do now

355
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.830
is we can dynamically

356
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.800
calculate the previous

357
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.280
and next pages

358
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.100
based on that page variable.

359
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.450
So the href of this link

360
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.930
is going to be equal to

361
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.620
forward slash products forward slash

362
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.543
and take the page minus one.

363
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.510
And if we hover over that,

364
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.350
we see zero,

365
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.300
we'll deal with the fact that

366
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.450
that's not actually something

367
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.820
in just a second

368
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.450
and then take that

369
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.003
and paste it on the next one.

370
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.047
And then I do plus one.

371
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.533
And that should,

372
00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:04.120
there we go forward slash two

373
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.820
when you hover over top

374
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.510
of that thing.

375
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.090
So if we want to disable that link

376
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.220
you could programmatically render this.

377
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.250
Like, what you could do here

378
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.813
is you could say,

379
00:12:17.813 --> 00:12:22.573
if the page is equal to one,

380
00:12:22.573 --> 00:12:23.580
because if we're

381
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.990
on the first page

382
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.780
or if it is not equal to one

383
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.560
then we could render out the link, right?

384
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.060
So something like that,

385
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.950
where you do and, and,

386
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.400
I got to put extra equals there.

387
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.310
There we go.

388
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.143
So you see how

389
00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:43.880
the previous button is gone.

390
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.100
And if we were to go to change

391
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.300
this page to two,

392
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.260
it should show up.

393
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.210
There we go.

394
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.230
See the preview button is there.

395
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.410
I don't like that

396
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.150
because I don't like it

397
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.730
when things shift

398
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.350
based on how many items there are

399
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.380
especially when you're clicking

400
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.213
next, next, next

401
00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:00.670
and the buttons are moving

402
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.200
from under your cursor.

403
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.450
So what I like to do is

404
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.970
if we take that back now is

405
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.450
I like to just disable the link

406
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.500
from happening if it has,

407
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.980
if it's a page that doesn't exist.

408
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.860
So what we can do here

409
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.870
is we can say Aria dash disabled.

410
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.703
Again, I'm using

411
00:13:18.703 --> 00:13:20.060
the accessibility attribute here

412
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.740
and then we'll use CSS

413
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.370
to actually stop someone

414
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.500
from clicking disable the previous one,

415
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.260
if the page is less

416
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.920
or equal to one

417
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.003
or you could say,

418
00:13:33.003 --> 00:13:34.330
if it is equal to one.

419
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.060
And now that should have,

420
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.363
if we take a look at it.

421
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.673
It should have

422
00:13:50.673 --> 00:13:52.310
a disabled attribute on it,

423
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.613
but does not.

424
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.970
Why would that be?

425
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.990
So let's try just manually pass

426
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.160
are you disabled equals

427
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.900
equal to true.

428
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.940
I have an inkling, yeah.

429
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.830
See, none of those are are showing.

430
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.040
I wonder if we just put

431
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.900
other random stuff on here,

432
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.213
data dash cool is equal to true.

433
00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:16.492
You see these attributes

434
00:14:16.492 --> 00:14:18.030
are not being passed down.

435
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.890
And I have an inkling feeling

436
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.700
that you cannot just pass

437
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.260
random attributes to the link tag.

438
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.436
And if you want to put

439
00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:29.311
additional attributes on

440
00:14:29.311 --> 00:14:31.870
your actual rendered anchor link,

441
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.230
you put an anchor link

442
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.070
inside of it.

443
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.530
So I'm gonna change this

444
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.130
around a quick sack

445
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.040
is if you just put an A tag

446
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.140
with no attributes on it

447
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.973
and then put the

448
00:14:42.973 --> 00:14:45.290
previous inside of there,

449
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.500
this is just an option.

450
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.330
This used to be the default index, yes,

451
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.830
but now they allow you

452
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.793
to not put it.

453
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.660
And then that will,

454
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.550
that still renders out

455
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.383
the exact same thing.

456
00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:57.980
But I believe now I can put

457
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.930
attributes like Aria disabled

458
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.330
on that link itself

459
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.513
and it should show up.

460
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.880
Yes, see, look it,

461
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.310
see how it shows up here.

462
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.143
So that's a little,

463
00:15:07.143 --> 00:15:07.976
a little thing

464
00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:08.809
you should need to know

465
00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:09.642
about next yes is

466
00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.240
if you're going to be putting things

467
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.552
other than prev

468
00:15:12.552 --> 00:15:13.810
and the other props

469
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.220
that are on link,

470
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.210
then you have to nest

471
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.470
an anchor link inside of it.

472
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.620
The only weird thing being

473
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.453
that the href,

474
00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:24.320
the href goes on the link

475
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.940
and not the actual anchor itself.

476
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.683
So I can get rid of that here.

477
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.930
And you see, see this,

478
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.280
data dot disabled

479
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.150
or Aria disabled on it.

480
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.983
If we take a look at

481
00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:40.230
our dev tools here, we have,

482
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.120
some CSS being applied,

483
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.780
color is equal to gray

484
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.550
and pointer events, none.

485
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.181
So that both visually tells the user

486
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:48.940
that you cannot click it.

487
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.200
And also accessibly tells any users

488
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.370
that they can not click it

489
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.143
because it is a disabled link.

490
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.620
Next up, we got to do the,

491
00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.453
the next link.

492
00:15:59.453 --> 00:16:00.670
Next up we need the next link.

493
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:01.990
So we'll go do the same thing.

494
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.490
We'll take the next text here.

495
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.980
We'll open and close an A tag,

496
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.380
and then we'll put the Aria

497
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.800
that's disabled on that one.

498
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.633
And for that one,

499
00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:15.030
we'll just say if the page

500
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.870
is greater or equal to,

501
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.420
what's that?

502
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.570
The number of pages

503
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.160
And do we, oh, page count,

504
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.163
not pages.

505
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.330
And now I believe,

506
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.230
so in our case,

507
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.060
we have seven pages.

508
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.893
So if we were to go

509
00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:34.810
manually change this

510
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.380
to page seven,

511
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.500
that should disable itself.

512
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.440
Boom, and you'll see the previous one

513
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.770
is now no longer disabled

514
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.323
cause we're on page seven.

515
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:47.120
All right, let's see where we're at.

516
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.790
Render the links, done.

517
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.350
Allow for dynamic routing.

518
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.880
No, we haven't done that just yet.

519
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.670
We've just rendered out the links.

520
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.820
So in the next video,

521
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.160
what we'll do is we'll pick it up

522
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.630
and do dynamic routing

523
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.970
and next JS as well

524
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.080
as we probably can fit

525
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.130
the filtering of the products

526
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.130
in that one as well.
