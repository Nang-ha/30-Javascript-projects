00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.960
<v Presenter>All right. Now we're gonna talk about</v>

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.330
the credit card checkout.

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.350
We're gonna be using Stripe to actually charge credit cards.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.390
Um, and then we're gonna be writing some custom mutations

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.180
on our back end to actually process those things cause

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.470
the whole Stripe checkout is sort of a two-step process.

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.210
First, you capture the user's credit card information

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.340
and any other information you need on the client,

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.500
you send that to Stripe,

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.210
Stripe comes back with what's called a token.

11
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.090
Um, that's sort of like,

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450
good for one credit card charge

13
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.190
worth of however much you want.

14
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.320
Um, and then you throw that token back to your server side

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.800
um, and then actually go through

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.620
with processing the transaction.

17
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.000
The reason why they do that is cause you never wanna send

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.410
credit card data to your actual server,

19
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.070
because there's a whole lot of compliance

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.100
that needs to happen if you're actually handling

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.960
credit card numbers on your server.

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660
And with the way Stripe does it,

23
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.760
you don't have to worry about that

24
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.150
cause it's only ever using tokens.

25
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.150
So you need to go to stripe.com and sign up for an account.

26
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.670
Um, and then when you're signed in,

27
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.900
you wanna make sure that you are in test.

28
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.420
I think by default they will put you in the test mode here.

29
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.520
I've just signed up for a completely separate account

30
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.830
called Wes Bos Tutorials

31
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.080
and I use this for all of my teaching.

32
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.490
Um, then what you wanna do is go to developers API keys

33
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.760
and we're going to make,

34
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.520
need to make an environmental variable that lives in

35
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.353
our frontend.

36
00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:31.340
So far we only have a .ENV file for our

37
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.173
backend,

38
00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:35.270
but we don't have .ENV file for our front end.

39
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.740
So I'm gonna show you how to do that.

40
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.640
Um, so next JS has an example right here.

41
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.410
You basically have to add a .ENV.local file

42
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.410
um, and then if you want to expose it to the browser,

43
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.900
you have to prefix it with NEXT_PUBLIC.

44
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.410
Gatsby does the same thing. Gatsby has to be gatsby_

45
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.650
So you explicitly expose

46
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.980
Environment Variables to the browser.

47
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.410
Because, otherwise if you have um,

48
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.860
private keys and things like that,

49
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.640
that shouldn't be there then they would be.

50
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.940
So we wanna go here, just go to the very root

51
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.720
of your next JS frontend folder

52
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.910
and .env

53
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.820
and it's .env.local.

54
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.388
Um, and then in here it says,

55
00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:25.373
NEXT_

56
00:02:25.373 --> 00:02:26.260
PUBLIC_

57
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.710
STRIPE

58
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.803
_KEY,

59
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.153
and that will be equal to whatever's in here.

60
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:38.843
Just go ahead and copy it and pop some quotes around it.

61
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.590
And then we wanna make sure that

62
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.220
this key is being piped into our frontend.

63
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.010
So just go somewhere like your Nav.js

64
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.410
and try to put it somewhere in your NAV.

65
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.410
I'm just gonna say process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY.

66
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.810
And we'll go to our frontend here.

67
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320
And I don't think it will show up by default.

68
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.040
No, I think we probably have to restart the frontend.

69
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.053
Let's try that.

70
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:13.418
There we go.

71
00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:16.930
There is, there's the key that we need.

72
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.510
Next, what we need to do is to create a checkout component

73
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.730
that we will be able to use Stripe end.

74
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.270
So go ahead and create a new file

75
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.323
call it Checkout.js.

76
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.530
And we'll make our custom component.

77
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.963
So function checkout.

78
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.053
And then from that, well return.

79
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.540
We'll call it checkout form styles.

80
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.980
We'll code those ourselves in just a sec

81
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.430
um, and then just put a paragraph tag in there

82
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.387
that says, "hey".

83
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.100
Now go above it and make those checkout form styles

84
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.080
real quick.

85
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.960
So checkout form styles

86
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.013
is equal to style.form tag.

87
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.520
The reason why we're not using our existing form here

88
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.353
is because

89
00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.930
we're actually not going to be handling any inputs

90
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.010
from the user.

91
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.180
Um, we're going to be using Stripe Elements

92
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.590
and Stripe Elements handles all the inputs for us.

93
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.980
Which is pretty cool.

94
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.660
So we'll go in here and say,

95
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.023
box-shadow:

96
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.370
0

97
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.203
1px

98
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:21.420
2px 2px

99
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.210
rgba(0,0,0,0.04).

100
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.660
Border: 1px

101
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.240
solid rgba (0,0, 0, 0.06)

102
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.330
just in very faint lines.

103
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.613
Border-radius:

104
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.800
5px.

105
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
Padding:

106
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.723
1rem.

107
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.650
Display

108
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.483
grid

109
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.050
and grid-gap:

110
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.320
1rem.

111
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.153
Okay.

112
00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:57.440
Um, now we need to go into our cart,

113
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.390
I can take this out we don't need that.

114
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:02.830
We don't need the page.

115
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.340
We don't need that and that.

116
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.880
I'll go into our Cart.js

117
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.380
and go all the way to the bottom AF

118
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.790
right underneath you where you formatted money

119
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.623
in the footer.

120
00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:16.193
And let's just put our checkout component in there.

121
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.183
And we'll import it.

122
00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:26.480
It doesn't look like it's importing itself.

123
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.940
Oh, we didn't export it.

124
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.100
Export

125
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.933
checkout.

126
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.533
Let's try it now.

127
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.680
Here we go.
Here it is.

128
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.700
Open up our cart and there we go.

129
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.470
There's our actual checkout form showing up.

130
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.780
Next we need to

131
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.930
start working on loading in the Stripe Elements.

132
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.320
So again, Stripe elements is a package that Stripe offers

133
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.120
that allow you to embed credit card fields

134
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.100
into your application

135
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.490
so that you don't actually have to fuss with

136
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.270
um, touching any credit card numbers yourself.

137
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.093
It actually happens all on Stripes form which is great.

138
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.730
So we will first load Stripe into the page

139
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.563
and the way that you can do that

140
00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:18.310
is, is cons Stripelib is equal to loadStripe.

141
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.450
And then you gotta give it your, your key.

142
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.906
And our key was, what was it?

143
00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:25.020
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY.

144
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.863
So process.env.

145
00:06:28.394 --> 00:06:29.780
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY

146
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.920
and then loadStripe

147
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.400
is a method that is exported from Stripe itself.

148
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.550
Doesn't look like it's working.

149
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.750
So let's try it ourselves.

150
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.997
Import

151
00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:40.830
loadStripe

152
00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:46.290
from @Stripe4/,

153
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.760
there's two libraries that Stripe has, Stripe.js.

154
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.930
That's their base.

155
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.240
Um, and then react Stripe.js is just their

156
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.730
react adaptation of their input.

157
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.460
So this one is Stripe-js.
That's what we need here.

158
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.360
Next we need to do is wrap our component in their provider.

159
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.020
Remember we talked about providers, we have an

160
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.540
ApolloProvider that provides information about Apollo.

161
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.940
We have our CART provider as reached above the cart is open.

162
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.550
Now we're gonna have a Stripe Elements provider.

163
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.950
That's gonna provide information about that.

164
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.380
So we just wrap it in an elements tag

165
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.980
and hopefully we can import that.

166
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.677
Yeah. We import elements from

167
00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:24.160
@stripe/react-Stripe-js

168
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.770
and then we'll wrap our entire component in that.

169
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.860
And then Stripe Elements actually needs

170
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.280
access to the stripeLib value right here.

171
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.110
Notice how I've required it outside of the component.

172
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.080
That's so that we're not accidentally

173
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.630
requiring it once every single time that, that thing loads.

174
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.333
So let's say Stripe is equal to stripeLib.

175
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.130
And we can go

176
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.290
to our

177
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.123
page here

178
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.180
and let's just open up the dev tools.

179
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
See if there's any, any errors.

180
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.500
Sometimes if you do something wrong,

181
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.490
Stripe will yell at you

182
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.150
and it looks like we're doing okay so far.

183
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.630
So the next thing that we wanna do

184
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.890
is actually start to embed

185
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.760
um, the credit card form element.

186
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.720
And that is simply just a thing called Card Element.

187
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.340
So we say Card Element

188
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.620
and import that again.

189
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.343
We're going to import that directly from Stripe Elements.

190
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.873
Get outta here!

191
00:08:21.873 --> 00:08:24.080
I can't see where my imports are. There we go.

192
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.460
They're an import,
Yeah. There we go.

193
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.403
Card Element.

194
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.910
And,(laughs)

195
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.743
look at that.

196
00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:31.910
We'll get rid of this, "hey"

197
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.430
and with that much work,

198
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.490
we are already seeing a mock-up

199
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.323
of

200
00:08:38.323 --> 00:08:39.630
the, there we go,

201
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.360
the card number, our expiry date,

202
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.330
and

203
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.700
that, which is pretty cool.

204
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.940
Um, there is an issue with these things going side by side.

205
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.470
That's not what I wanted here.

206
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.730
Um, our footer

207
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.173
is a grid.

208
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.070
Let's see, where is that style coming from?

209
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.120
Cause we need to write a little bit more.

210
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.360
Here we go.

211
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.193
Footer.

212
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.580
Let's change these ourselves.
It's in cart styles.

213
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.453
Um, the footer is grid-template-columns auto auto.

214
00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:23.390
I don't believe that this actually needs to be grid at all.

215
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.410
So let's take those off and there we go.

216
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.950
Now we've got the credit card input here

217
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.950
and the month, the year CVC automatically showing up.

218
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.500
Finally, we need to hook up a button that will submit it.

219
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.320
Um, so we'll go back to our checkout here

220
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.690
and we'll

221
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.650
give ourselves

222
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.110
a sick button.

223
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.340
So this is a button I've given you in the styles folder.

224
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.210
So I'll try to import that.

225
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.550
Now we'll go up here.

226
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.383
Import

227
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.590
sick

228
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.423
button

229
00:09:53.423 --> 00:09:54.870
from

230
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.480
styles

231
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.830
sick button.

232
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.663
Here we go.

233
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.670
And then go down to our sick button.

234
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.030
Closed it on me.
Come on now!

235
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.530
Here we go.

236
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.513
And we'll say, check out now.

237
00:10:11.517 --> 00:10:13.060
Here we go.
That gives us our nice little

238
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.650
button that's showing up.

239
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.760
So

240
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.610
the last thing we wanna do is

241
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.250
that when somebody submits this form

242
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.480
we need to do a whole lot of steps

243
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.493
of going to Stripe, getting our token,

244
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.880
calculating how much the total thing will be

245
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.860
all of that good stuff.

246
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.190
So what we'll do is we'll take that our form

247
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.360
and say on submit

248
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.220
is

249
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.484
equal to we'll call it, handle

250
00:10:36.484 --> 00:10:39.900
submit.

251
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.640
I'll go right inside it.

252
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.580
We're still inside the checkout form and make

253
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.560
a function here called handle submit

254
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.050
that has event.

255
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.970
And we'll just event.preventDefault

256
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.520
and console.log.

257
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.573
We gotta do some work.

258
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.060
So

259
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.453
open up our dev tools.

260
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.550
Check out now.

261
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.800
Here we go.
We gotta do some work.

262
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.730
Okay. So that's the very basics of the, the groundwork.

263
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.460
Nothing works yet, but we have the sort of

264
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.750
the base of it.

265
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.970
Um, in the next couple of videos we're going to get into

266
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.830
um,

267
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.640
talking to Stripe as well as talking to our custom back end

268
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.283
so that we can create our orders.
