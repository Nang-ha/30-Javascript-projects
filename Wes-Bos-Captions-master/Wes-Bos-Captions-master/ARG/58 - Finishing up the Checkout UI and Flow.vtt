00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Wes>All right, there's a bunch</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120
of little housekeeping items that need to happen.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.500
First, the cart shows 12 items.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.160
Yours might not show anything,

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.710
and I think it's related to the fact

6
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.410
that I have deleted products in my cart still.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.810
And I'm not deleting...

8
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.560
I haven't deleted them.

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410
So we've got to fix that.

10
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.290
Second is we need to change the page

11
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.330
when the order is created.

12
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.190
Three, we need to close the cart.

13
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.190
Four, we need to refetch the user's cart

14
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.793
when they buy something.

15
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.170
And I think that's it,

16
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290
just a whole bunch of little front end stuff.

17
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.430
So first one is that my cart shows 12 items.

18
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.990
And if I refresh the page,

19
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.310
there's still 12 items in there.

20
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.120
And there's nothing in here.

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.700
And I believe that has to do with the fact

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.990
that I have items in my cart where the product is deleted.

23
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.920
And we counted for those items

24
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.800
in showing the cart right here,

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.320
but we didn't account for them when we were counting them.

26
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
So let's flip to our front end now.

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.600
And I believe that's in our nav.js.

28
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.720
Yeah, here we go.

29
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.710
Where we reduce the cart,

30
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.763
and we just tally up how many are in there.

31
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.140
And in this case,

32
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.730
we either need to return the quantity if the product exists

33
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.200
or zero if the product is been deleted.

34
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.570
So what we can do is just put these dits parentheses.

35
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.570
And I'm gonna say if there is a cartitem.product,

36
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.083
then return the quantity, otherwise return zero.

37
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.790
Okay, so that updated it to zero.

38
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.910
The next thing is that

39
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.770
shouldn't have even been an issue for me

40
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.510
because we should have deleted all the cart items.

41
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.930
Regardless of if they have a product or not,

42
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.550
every cart item in the user's cart

43
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.540
should be deleted, right?

44
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.900
And if we go to our keystone

45
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.200
and look at our cart items here,

46
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.000
you see there's still two more cart items left.

47
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.300
There's 11 of this one and one of that one

48
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.200
which is why it was showing 12.

49
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.020
And if I click through to it,

50
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.810
you'll see there's no associated product

51
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.620
because that product was deleted.

52
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.620
So our backend mutation where we delete them all,

53
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.500
we were mapping over cartItems.

54
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.377
But if you take a look at cartItems,

55
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.230
cartItems was the filtered cart.

56
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.810
We want the unfiltered cart.

57
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.030
So that's a really easy fix is that we just have to go

58
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.970
and swap out this cartItems for user.cart.

59
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.190
And that will ensure whether there's a product that's there

60
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.560
or it's been deleted,

61
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.163
doesn't matter, they all get deleted.

62
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.020
So that is the first part.

63
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.270
Next one, change the page when the order is created,

64
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.470
close the cart and refetch the user's cart

65
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.303
when they buy something.

66
00:02:56.303 --> 00:02:59.180
So two, change the page when the order is created.

67
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.030
Okay, let's go back to the front end.

68
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.683
We'll go to our checkout here.

69
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.570
And here we go, change the page to...

70
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.260
So what I'll do is we'll go grab the router.

71
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.093
So that's a hook,

72
00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:14.527
so const router is equal to useRouter.

73
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.393
Make sure you import that from next.

74
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.630
Then right here, change the page

75
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.690
to view the router, router.push.

76
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.030
We wanna push it.

77
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.590
The path name is going to be /order,

78
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.560
and the query is going to have

79
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.023
an ID of the returned order.

80
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.573
So it's order.data.checkout.id.

81
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.690
Close the cart, that's pretty easy to do.

82
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.223
Don't we have a closeCart function?

83
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.350
Let's look at the useCart.

84
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.120
Where did we do our useCart?

85
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.713
Was it in cart.js?

86
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.773
No, where it was...

87
00:04:04.773 --> 00:04:06.240
You can just click through to it.

88
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.980
It's in cartstate.js.

89
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
We have a function called closeCart, right?

90
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.320
So we should be able to just grab that.

91
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.637
We can leave that method in

92
00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:18.750
and just go import it at the top.

93
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.150
See how handy these hooks are?

94
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.200
So const, we'll do structure,

95
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.290
closeCart is equal to useCart.

96
00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:30.464
And we got to import useCart.

97
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.190
So that should close the cart,

98
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.530
and then turn the loader off.

99
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.830
Set loading false and progress done.

100
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.183
Okay, so that's that.

101
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.810
The next thing was refetch the user's cart

102
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.400
when they buy something.

103
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.650
Okay, so because we are not refreshing the page

104
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.483
once they buy something,

105
00:04:54.483 --> 00:04:56.000
we're just pushing them to another one,

106
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.590
we got to go to this mutation right here.

107
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.930
And one of the arguments

108
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.080
that we pass here is refetchQueries.

109
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.080
That's an array with the query of current_user_query.

110
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.460
That was imported from our user component.

111
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.480
And that should do it, okay.

112
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
So let's go over those real quick.

113
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.930
The cart items, we've we went over that.

114
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.970
Change the page when the order is created,

115
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.820
that should now work.

116
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.010
Close the cart, that should now work

117
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.960
and refetch the user's-

118
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.120
Let's test all of that.

119
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.820
So we'll go to our front end here.

120
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.600
And let's add some items to our cart,

121
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.310
and go to here, and we'll check out.

122
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.610
By the way, I recommend making your prices

123
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.910
as high as possible

124
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.880
because it feels good when you're fake stripe

125
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.100
is full of lots of money.

126
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.593
So let's go and check out, bum, bum, bum.

127
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.040
Hey!

128
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.850
All right, I think almost everything worked.

129
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.490
The cart closed, the cart is now empty.

130
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.760
It changed the page,

131
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.770
although I don't see the ID of the order the query param,

132
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.013
so we'll have to go to that in just a second.

133
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.450
If we go to our backend orders,

134
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.633
there's a new order showing up right here.

135
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.240
And yeah, everything's work except this one.

136
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.300
For some reason, the pushing of the page

137
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.470
did not take the ID.

138
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.450
The query did not come along.

139
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.280
So what I'm gonna do is let's look at

140
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.700
the order that comes back.

141
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.850
Maybe this is not the right path to what we want.

142
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.140
Unfortunately, I didn't keep the dev tools

143
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.160
open when that happened.

144
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.940
So we got to make another one just so we can see

145
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.810
what the order looks like.

146
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.110
So products, add to cart.

147
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.843
Go here, check out.

148
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.510
There we go, there's our data.

149
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.343
That's the order, so data.checkout.id.

150
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.930
So order.data.checkout.id, okay.

151
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.253
That fine, why is it not going in the URL?

152
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.883
Let's take a look at the next docs for that.

153
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.010
Shallow, oh, I wonder if they took

154
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.053
the query option off of that?

155
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.450
Well, well, we can pass it ourselves here.

156
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.663
Oh no, no, it should work.

157
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.923
There we go.

158
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.063
Path name and the query.

159
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:55.010
I don't know, maybe that has changed since I've done it

160
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.230
because we don't have a square bracket in it.

161
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.690
So if we just wanna pass a query param along with it,

162
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.040
I bet we just have to interpolate it ourselves.

163
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.970
So let's say ID is equal to...

164
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.860
Oh, we got to do it here.

165
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.643
ID is equal to the order.data.checkout.id.

166
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.430 line:15% 
And obviously the other thing I didn't mention

167
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.500 line:15% 
is that's not a page yet.

168
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.810 line:15% 
We haven't created that yet.

169
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.940 line:15% 
That's why it's 404ing.

170
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.920 line:15% 
But we certainly will go to that page in just a bit.

171
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.130
So let's go through the whole song and dance one more time.

172
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.630
Let's go to products,

173
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.013
add something to the cart.

174
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.343
Go ahead and checkout.

175
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.803
Check out now.

176
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.850
And...

177
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.170
Ah, now it's encoding the question mark.

178
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.413
That's not what we want.

179
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.070
So I searched around,

180
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.160
and I'm sure we could encode that.

181
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.610
But that seems like a bit of a hack.

182
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.110
So let's just do it the next way.

183
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.450
And instead of doing query params like that,

184
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.420
let's just go to order/id.

185
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.263
And then we'll say the query,

186
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.520
ID is equal to that.

187
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.470
And I bet that will fix it for us.

188
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.950
So we'll do the forward slash instead of query param.

189
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.190
So try it one more time.

190
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.313
Add something to the cart, check out.

191
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.113
Check out, boom.

192
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.540
And there we go,

193
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.100
the URL is up and running.

194
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.500
Again, the reason why we're getting this

195
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.350
is because we haven't created that page.

196
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.410
But now we actually are getting proper URLs.

197
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.240
Again, if we go to our backend here,

198
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.300
we see there's a whole bunch of orders been created

199
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.133
since I did that.

200
00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:56.860
So that is the checkout flow.

201
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.650
And that brings us to the next section

202
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.050
which is actually displaying

203
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.753
the user's orders and individual orders.
